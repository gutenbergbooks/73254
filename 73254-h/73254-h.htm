<h2>Chapter I. <br> An Invitation to Dinner</h2>

<p>As a rule the first of June always found Bartley out
of the city. With the coming of the first days of spring,
he would begin to grow restless. One would find upon
the large rosewood desk in his library various fishing
flies, and maps showing far-off lakes and streams. For
a while he would even drop his books and pamphlets
which told of the 18th century of France, and pore
over various guides of the woods and mountains;
and then when June arrived, we would take the big
car and go wandering forth in search of rest.</p>

<p>But the first of June had come and gone, and it was
now the middle of the month. What was worse, there
did not seem to be the slightest chance that we could
get away for many weeks to come. Down in the Court
House a sensational murder trial was slowly dragging
itself out to a conclusion—a conclusion not yet in sight.
It was this trial which was keeping us in the city, for
Bartley's testimony was the hope upon which the
defense leaned for an acquittal.</p>

<p>The stay in the city might have been endured if it
had not been for the weather. For over a week we
had sweltered under the warmest heat spell of many a
year. Each morning I rose with but one thought in
my mind—that there would be a breeze. But every
day the thermometer went a few degrees higher than
the day before—while each evening the list of those
overcome by the heat grew larger. Bartley, far more
of a philosopher than myself, at my constant
complaint that it was warm, suggested that I follow the
example of Trouble, our Airedale, who retired each
morning to the cellar to spend the day.</p>

<p>One evening toward the end of the third week in
June I entered Bartley's house in Gramercy Square
long after our usual dinner hour. Going to the dining
room, I found that Bartley had eaten several hours
before. Rance, our old colored man, served me with the
air of one who felt insulted over the fact my delay had
caused his well-cooked dinner to grow cold. It was
not until I was drinking my coffee that he unbent so
far as to inform me that Bartley wished to see me in
the library.</p>

<p>Bartley's library had once been called the most
distinctive room in the city. When he had remodeled the
house, he had torn away all the partitions to make one
huge room. It ran across the entire front of the house,
and had one of the largest fireplaces I have ever seen.
The walls were covered with French prints—not copies,
but the rare originals of the eighteenth century.
Boucher, Fragonard, and their contemporaries covered
three of the walls, while the fourth was left for the
Belgian—Rops—whose devilish suggestiveness leered at
one in over sixty etchings.</p>

<p>Below the etchings ran the bookcases, filled with the
books which Bartley loved; not ordinary books, but
the rare things upon crime and science, philosophy and
psychology—the cream of a lifetime of collecting. And
then came the long rows of thin volumes, with their
dark red covers—the most extensive collection in the
country, of the rare pamphlets and memoirs of the
years before the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Bartley was seated by his large rosewood desk,
whose surface was covered with books and papers. He
even looked cool in his white silk suit, and he smiled
when I mentioned the heat. With that he went back
to the book he was reading, while I picked up the
evening paper and went over to an easy chair. There
was nothing of importance in the paper, though the
murder trial filled many columns—columns of the usual
sob stuff, but with little information. In disgust, I
threw the paper aside just as Bartley spoke.</p>

<p>“Pelt,” he said, “I received a letter this morning from
Carter. He is very eager to have us come up and visit
him.”</p>

<p>I was rather surprised at this, for I had thought
Carter was on the other side of the water. Seeing my
astonishment, Bartley continued:</p>

<p>“George writes me that his chief has given him the
summer to rest in. He is at the old home, and wants
us to spend part of the summer with him.”</p>

<p>Carter's father had made a fortune out of some
so-called cure for rheumatism. It is much to be doubted
if it ever cured any one, but it did result in George
receiving a large sum of money when his father died.
But money meant little to Carter, while adventure
promised a great deal more. In some manner, Carter
got into the Secret Service, where he surprised those
who looked upon him as being only a rich man's son,
by becoming the best man his chief had. Though there
was at least fifteen years of difference in their ages,
Bartley and he were the warmest of friends. I was
thinking of this as Bartley's voice interrupted my
thoughts.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking, Pelt, that there is not the
slightest reason in the world for your staying in the
city. I can not get away until after I have testified in
the trial; and the way it looks now, only the Lord
Himself knows when that will be. But it is absurd for you
to stay in the city while it is so warm. Why don't you
take the small car and the dog and go to Carter's? I
will come as soon as I can.”</p>

<p>Carter's home was in what has often been called the
most beautiful village in the state of New York. It
lay under the shadow of a range of hills, with a lake at
the front door. And the lawn of Carter's house fronted
the lake. But though the suggestion appealed to me,
still I did not like the idea of leaving Bartley alone in
the city; I said as much, only to have him retort:</p>

<p>“That's foolish, Pelt. Your hanging around here can
do no good. And there is another reason why I want
you to go up. Carter writes me that James Ranville is
his guest; and I want you to meet him.”</p>

<p>Seeing my blank look, he enlightened me. Ranville,
it seemed, was an inspector from Scotland Yard who
was visiting in America. During the war he and Carter
had worked together on several cases, and he had
crossed the ocean to visit his friend. Bartley informed
me that Ranville was one of the best men Scotland
Yard had, and urged strongly that I follow his
suggestion and run up to Carter's. And so, though I
protested rather keenly that I did not wish to run away,
at last I agreed to go the next morning; and when I
said this, he returned to his book.</p>

<p>Four o'clock the next afternoon found me driving
down the wide, tree-lined street of Carter's town. It
had been an easy drive across the central part of the
state, though Trouble, the Airedale, protested several
times that he thought we had driven far enough. The
last seventy-five miles—miles which led through
peaceful valleys and along the side of shady mountains—had
passed quickly. Though it was warm, yet from the
hills had come a slight breeze, and the air was heavy
with the scent of the fields and woods.</p>

<p>As I drove slowly down the main street, I could see
that the village was a wealthy one, and quite a summer
place. White, colonial houses in the midst of wide
lawns were set far back from the street. The streets
were lined with huge elm trees, whose branches met in
a green arch above my head. The cars that I passed
were expensive ones, and the few people I saw looked
as though they not only had plenty of leisure, but all
the money they could use.</p>

<p>Carter's place was down by the lake, and the
directions which Bartley had given me were so complete
that I had no trouble in finding it. A green hedge hid
the lawn from the street, and large trees shaded the
house—a house whose red-shingled top I could see
ahead of me. I turned in the drive which ran between
two rows of roses—roses red as flame in the summer
sun—and stopped the car in front of the house. It
fronted a lawn which ended at the lake. As the car
stopped, a man ran down the steps to greet me; it was
Carter.</p>

<p>Any one who saw him would have decided that he
had never done a stroke of work in his life. His silk
suit was of wonderful texture. The fit was that which
only the most expensive tailor can give, and the tie
which floated in the breeze was very far from being
sedate. His whole appearance was that of a young
man who found life very good, and the task of
spending his money rather easy. The blond hair was closely
cut, and the little mustache gave him rather an affected
look. No one seeing Carter for the first time would
have guessed his reputation in the Secret Service.</p>

<p>He greeted me with evident pleasure and then asked
in surprise where Bartley might be, expressing his
regrets when I told him why I had come alone. Then,
telling me to leave my things in the car and that his
man would take them to my room, he whistled to the
dog and we went to the veranda. It ran across the
front of the house—a veranda with easy chairs and
bright porch hammocks. Here he proposed that I rest
until he had brought me out a drink, and with that he
went into the house.</p>

<p>For a while I studied the view before me. A few
yards away the green grass of the lawn ended at the
waters of the lake. It was not a small lake, and I
judged it must be several miles to the other shore. Far
away I could see the mountains, their summits dark
and cool against the blue sky. Under the slight breeze
the waters of the lake lapped the shore with a gentle
murmur, and the sound of the exhaust of a motor boat
came faintly to my ears. Not only was it beautiful
but also restful, and I gave a contended grin as I
thought of the hot city I had left.</p>

<p>Carter returned in a few moments with a tray—a
tray which had three tall glasses in which ice tinkled
with a pleasing sound. He was not alone, for with him
was a tall man whom I judged must have been around
forty-five—a man who carried himself with an air of
distinction, and whose hair had begun to turn white.
When they reached my side, Carter introduced him
as his friend Ranville, the inspector from Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p>Ranville was not the usual blond Saxon, nor for that
matter did his speech have much of an English
accent. A glance at his well-knit frame and his brick-red
face told that he spent much of his time in the open
air. He took my hand with a firm clasp and expressed
his regrets that Bartley had been unable to come with
me. There was something very likable about the man,
and there were the little lines around his lips which
showed that he had a sense of humor.</p>

<p>Sinking into our chairs, we slowly sipped our
highballs, talking of this and that. The dog, glad at his
release from the car, wandered about the yard, only to
plunge at last into the waters of the lake. Then, as
there came a long silence, Carter said:</p>

<p>“I will take you up to your room, Pelt. We are
going out to dinner to-night. That is one reason I am
sorry Bartley is not here.”</p>

<p>I turned an inquiring glance in his direction, and he
gave a grin as he replied:</p>

<p>“You are going to meet a real highbrow for once,
Pelt. We dine with Professor Henry Warren. You
know this town is his birthplace.”</p>

<p>Though like every person who had read the
newspapers during the last few months I knew of
Henry Warren, I was rather surprised to hear we were
to dine with him. Warren had just returned to
America after a two years' absence in China. For many
weeks before his return the papers had been asking if
he were still alive. For months nothing had been heard
from his expedition, and his sudden arrival in Hong
Kong, after it had been announced that he had been
killed by outlaws, had created some excitement.</p>

<p>But it was something else which had caused the
name of Warren to go upon the front pages of every
newspaper in the world. Not only was he one of the
greatest scientists in America, but he was considered
our leading authority upon evolution and the origin of
man. The world had been startled by a statement he
made upon his arrival in Hong Kong: That he had
made discoveries which settled for all time the question
of the origin of man; but what these discoveries were
no one knew, for the scientist had refused to give even
a hint. Instead he had simply announced that he would
say nothing more until he had time to complete the
manuscript of his book.</p>

<p>Carter must have been thinking the same thing that
I had been running over in my mind, for there came
his laughing voice:</p>

<p>“They say he discovered the missing link or
something of that kind.”</p>

<p>“They made a big fuss over the cable reports of his
discovery in our London papers,” was Ranville's
comment. “What sort of a chap is he?”</p>

<p>Carter lighted a cigarette and laughed as he
answered.</p>

<p>“Well, to start with, Warren is not at all the usual
college professor. He has all kinds of money, and his
teaching at Harvard is simply a hobby. Most of his
time he spends in exploration in various parts of the
world. He has been everywhere. But this place
happens to be his old home, and he has a big summer
estate here. Just now he is writing his book upon
whatever it was he found in China.”</p>

<p>“They tell me that he has a rather touchy
disposition,” was my retort.</p>

<p>“Well,” drawled Carter, “I doubt if Warren knows
what the word ‘fear’ means. And all his life he has had
his own way. He doesn't like many people, saying
that they bore him because they know nothing. He can
overlook anything but ignorance and stupidity. But
it's my idea that when you meet him to-night, you will
like him.”</p>

<p>With that he gave a glance at his watch and, rising,
said that it was time to dress for dinner. Showing me
to my room, he told me we would not have to wear our
evening clothes, and asked that I be ready in thirty
minutes. As he left the room, I went to the windows
and glanced without. At my feet lay the lake, and for
a moment I watched the sun as it played upon the
distant hills. Then my eyes fell upon the Airedale,
asleep under a tree by the water's edge.</p>

<p>When I went downstairs after my bath, I had to
wait a few moments for Carter and his friend. Going
out into the yard, I placed the car in the garage, and
though the dog protested a little, left him with the
machine. Starting to stroll rather aimlessly around the
grounds, which covered several acres, I was hailed in
the end by Carter, who wanted to know where I had
been hiding.</p>

<p>As we left the yard, he informed us that we would
walk to Warren's, which he said was only a little more
than a mile away. We went down the wide street—a
street with large summer homes. Homes, set in the
midst of great lawns, which were hidden from our sight
by the tall hedges which enclosed the grounds. Not
only did the street speak of wealth, but also of age,
for most of the homes were the large colonial homes of
a remote day. Far in the distance I could see the white
steeples of the churches which peered above the tall
elms.</p>

<p>A few moments later we followed a winding road
which ran along the bank of the lake. Here the lawns
had given place to extensive summer estates, and the
houses were set far back from the road. The road
ended before a stone wall—a wall at least ten feet high,
which Carter told us surrounded Warren's estate. We
passed through the iron gate to go up a driveway. A
driveway lined on each side by a high box hedge, and
which ended some yards away at a rambling white
house. At the door of the house we waited for some
one to answer the bell.</p>

<p>For some reason we had a long wait, and Carter had
to ring the bell several times before the door was
opened. When it was thrown aside, a woman, whom I
judged must be the housekeeper, looked at us in a
questioning manner. Carter mentioned that we were
invited to dinner, and then, after remarking that she
knew this, she rather nervously opened the door wider
and asked us to come in. Taking us down a long hall,
she showed us into the living room and left.</p>

<p>It was an enormous room. The floor was covered
with valuable rugs. Etchings and pictures, which
Warren had picked up in all parts of the world, were on the
walls. Cabinets which were filled with priceless china,
and curios of all sorts were on every side of us. It was
an odd sort of a room, partly because of the great
confusion it was in. It almost looked as if the explorer
had simply thrown into the one room all the things
which he had picked up in his travels.</p>

<p>But it was an interesting room because of the things
it contained. Ranville smiled a happy little smile as
he went from one article to another. The various
curios so interested us that we forgot the passing of
time and almost an hour passed before it dawned upon
us that we had been alone in the room a long time.
Then all at once Carter gave a glance at his watch and
uttered a low exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>“Do you know what time it is?” he asked.</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply he went on: “It's now
eight o'clock, and Warren said the dinner was to be at
seven. It's odd he has kept us waiting as long as
this.”</p>

<p>There was nothing we could say, and no one spoke.
Again we turned to the curios in the cabinets, but as
the moments passed and there was no sign of either our
host or his housekeeper, we began to look at one
another. It seemed very strange to be invited to dinner
and not have our host welcome us. And we had seen
no signs of him. There was not a sound in the house,
and if it had not been that the housekeeper had let us
in, we might have thought we were alone. And then,
just as we began to wonder what we had better do, the
housekeeper came into the room.</p>

<p>It needed but a glance at her flushed face to tell that
not only was she nervous, but also rather perplexed.
She was a rather large woman with a determined
face—a face which now looked very troubled. She must
have known Carter, for she came across the room to
his side and said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Carter, my dinner has been waiting since seven
o'clock. But Mr. Warren is not in the house.”</p>

<p>He made the usual reply that one would make at
such a remark, only to have the woman say:</p>

<p>“He cannot have been delayed, for I know where
he is.”</p>

<p>I saw a keen look come into Ranville's eyes as he
turned to look at the woman. She stood before us
twisting the corner of her apron with nervous fingers.
But it was Carter who asked:</p>

<p>“You know where he is?”</p>

<p>The housekeeper hesitated for a second, then
replied:</p>

<p>“Yes. He is in his library. You know, Mr. Carter,
that his study and library is in that stone building on
the hill. He spends his afternoons there writing on his
new book. I know he went there this afternoon.
And—” the voice trailed off into silence.</p>

<p>“And what?” came Ranville's low voice.</p>

<p>The woman raised her head and her eyes swept over
the three of us. There was not only a look of anxiety
in them but, I thought, also a trace of fear. But why
there should be the last I failed to understand. But
fear there was. She started to speak, hesitated a
second, as if she did not wish to put into words what
was in her mind, and then suddenly said in a voice
which shook a little:</p>

<p>“Only—I don't know what to say. I have called up
his library a dozen times, and he does not answer. I
went down to the building and called his name, but no
answer. Then I tried the door, and it was locked—and
he never locks the door when he is working. Then
I pounded on the door, but still no one said anything in
reply. And—” Once again came silence, and the
look of fear crept again across her face. She gave us
one bewildered appealing look and wailed:</p>

<p>“He ought to be in his library. I know he was there,
but he won't answer the phone, and he did not come
to the door. And when I knocked I thought—” For
a moment she paused again.</p>

<p>For some reason none of us spoke. Our eyes were
upon the frightened face of the woman, whose nervous
fingers were never still. And then all at once she lifted
her head and completed the sentence.</p>

<p>“And when I knocked at the door, I thought I heard
something move inside the library.”</p>

<h2>Chapter II. <br> The Crooked Cross</h2>

<p>There fell a silence for a moment—a silence in
which the housekeeper moved nervously over to a
near-by chair. Carter's air of boredom had vanished, and a
quick look passed between his English friend and
himself; a glance which held until the English police
officer slowly nodded his head. Then came Carter's cool
voice, with the suggestion that we might go to the
summer house and see if Warren was there.</p>

<p>Carter must have known the way, for as we came out
of the house to the lawn, he turned to follow a graveled
path which led away to the right. It ran between two
high box hedges, so high that we could not see over
them. Then it passed through an old-fashioned
garden, only in the end to run in a winding fashion up a
small hill—a hill covered with many trees, and which
had upon it a stone building.</p>

<p>When the housekeeper had spoken of the summer
house, I had pictured the usual small wooden
building; but the place we were approaching was not of
wood, nor for that matter was it small. Instead of
being what I had expected, it was one of those curious
eight-sided buildings which you find once in a while in
central New York. And it was the size of the usual
small house.</p>

<p>It stood upon the very top of the hill, with a small
but very well kept lawn before it. Ivy climbed over
its sides, and a small piazza was directly in front of us.
When we went upon the veranda, I saw that it gave the
best view that I had seen during the day. The lake lay
only a few hundred feet away, seemingly at our very
feet. Far away the mountains faded away in the
growing darkness; but we gave but a glance at the view,
turning to the door before us.</p>

<p>It had been a rather warm day, and for that matter
it was still warm; but the great oak door in front of us
was closed, and the near-by window, which was set very
high, was closed also. There was no bell, though upon
the door was the most curious knocker that I had ever
seen. I raised the copper devil's head which formed
the knocker and let it fall. Then we waited for some
one to respond.</p>

<p>We knocked again and again, and even shouted.
But no reply came from within. Without a word
Carter made a gesture, and we followed him around the
eight sides of the building. On each side was a large
window, but placed about eight feet above the ground;
windows with small panes of leaded glass, so high that
one could not look within; and windows which were
shut. In the rear we found another door, also locked,
and though we knocked upon it, it was of no avail.</p>

<p>Back again at the veranda, we stood a moment in
thought. After all, there did not seem to be anything
else we could do. That Warren was not in his library
was, of course, the only logical thing to believe. If he
had been, he would not have had the doors and the
windows locked upon such a warm evening. The odd
thing was that we should be invited to dinner and no
host appeared to receive us.</p>

<p>I suggested to Carter that we had better return to
the house, and then go home. He listened a moment,
gave one reflective glance at the lake, and then turned
to look at the closed door before us. Then, with a
slight frown on his face, he said:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you're right, Pelt. Yet it's very queer that
Warren invited us to dinner and left us in the lurch
like this. He must have gone away.”</p>

<p>“Carter,” came Ranville's voice, “is Warren the sort
of man who would invite a guest to dinner and then
run off without a word?”</p>

<p>His friend shook his head. “Far from it; of course,
Warren does just about as he pleases. But he was very
urgent about our coming. Still, he was writing his
account of his discoveries in China in his library, and he
might have forgotten the passing of time.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” drawled Ranville, “but then when it
began to grow dark he would know it was late. And
besides, that building is locked. The door is closed, the
windows down. He would not work in the dark
without lights, and it is dark now.”</p>

<p>“That is all true,” was Carter's retort. “But what
would you do? We cannot smash a man's door down
simply because he did not turn up to meet his dinner
guests. We had better go back to the house.”</p>

<p>But when we reached the house, it was only to find
the same situation as when we left. Not only had the
owner not returned, but the housekeeper, who met us at
the front door, was even more excited than before.
Her round face was flushed, and when she led us into
the living room, her fingers shook so much that it was
a second or so before she could turn on all the lights.</p>

<p>Carter told her that we had been to the summer
house, but had seen or heard nothing of Warren. He
added that the doors and windows were closed. Then
he laughed and said there was no doubt Mr. Warren
had been called to town, and had forgotten all about
the fact we were to have been his guests. He no sooner
stopped speaking, when the woman started, and there
was no question that she placed very little faith in
what Carter had said.</p>

<p>She told us that if Mr. Warren had gone to town, he
would have come to the house for his coat. He worked
in a light summer suit, which he never wore to town.
And the coat of the suit was hanging on a rack in the
hall. Not only that, he never walked if he could ride.
And his two cars were in the garage. And then came
the statement which surprised us. She paused for a
moment, only to suddenly cry:</p>

<p>“I am afraid of that Chinaman.”</p>

<p>There came a startled look from Ranville, and he
asked in a surprised voice: “What Chinaman?”</p>

<p>In a voice which showed all the distrust and fear
that country women have of foreigners she replied:</p>

<p>“There was a Chinaman who came to the door
before six o'clock. He asked for Mr. Warren, and I
showed him how to get to the library. He wore a white
suit and spoke English pretty good. But I did not like
his face; and ever since he came here I have been
afraid—”</p>

<p>She paused, her face twitching with emotion, then
said:</p>

<p>“As Mr. Warren had not come back to the house, I
went to the library just before you came. I knocked
and knocked on the door. But no one answered. I
had called up on the 'phone, but there was no reply.
And when I knocked, or just before I knocked the first
time, I thought I heard some one inside. But after I
had pounded on the door there was not a sound.”</p>

<p>Suddenly her voice broke and, giving us an
appealing look, she asked if we would not go back to the
library and break open one of the windows, so we
could get within. There was no doubt she was afraid
something had happened to Warren. When she
finished speaking, there was just one response. It came
from Ranville.</p>

<p>“I think we better do as she says, Carter,” was all
he said.</p>

<p>At these words the woman ran from the room,
returning in a moment with two flashlights, which she
gave us. She half started to follow us from the piazza,
and then, as if thinking better of her resolution, stopped
by the door. As we went down the steps to the ground,
our last sight was the housekeeper, standing in the open
door with the light from the hall streaming out into
the night.</p>

<p>It was now dark. As we retraced our steps, the high
hedges on each side of the path caused the walk to
appear like a black tunnel. Above our heads we could
catch a glimpse of the stars, and could hear the faint
rustle of the branches of the trees. For some reason
no one spoke, nor for that matter did we hurry.</p>

<p>Climbing the slight hill, we approached the
building, which loomed a dark mass before us. On the
veranda we paused for a second, and then the darkness
was split by the sudden ray from Carter's flashlight.
We tried the door again, but it was still locked, and
there came no response to our knock. The window
was six or seven feet above our heads, and to reach it
some one would have to do a little climbing.</p>

<p>As I was the lightest, they proposed to lift me from
the floor to the ledge of the window. If I found it was
locked, I was to break the glass, lift the window, and
climb into the room. Ranville gave me his hand, and
I reached the sill. Balancing myself on the narrow
ledge, I tried to peer into the room, but it was a dense
black shadow of gloom. Nothing could be
distinguished, and though I waited a second, the only sound
to come to my ears was the wind in the branches of the
near-by trees.</p>

<p>Trying the window, I found it locked. Then Carter
reached up to me the second flashlight, and without
turning it on I broke the glass with the heavy end.
The glass fell with a tinkling sound to the floor, and
slipping my hand through the hole, I turned the catch
and lifted the window. As I did this, I dropped the
flashlight, which fell with a thud within the room.
Hesitating a second, I dropped into the library and
fumbled on the floor for the flashlight.</p>

<p>I found it without any trouble and, putting on the
catch, played the light hastily around the room. Just
what I expected to see I cannot say; but the brief
sweep which I made over the floor and the walls
revealed nothing. The room evidently took in the entire
house, and the walls showed only long lines of books,
and a gallery which ran around the eight sides. In the
center was a large desk, the surface littered with books
and papers. But of Warren there was not a trace.</p>

<p>Turning the light to the door, I found the spring lock
was on. It took but a second to fling the door open,
and Carter and Ranville slipped within. The same
question was on both faces, and I slowly shook my
head in reply. Carter's first words were for me to find
the switch for the lights. The button was near the
door, and, pressing it, the room in an instant was a blaze
of light.</p>

<p>The room was octagonal in shape, with a window
placed high on each of the sides. The wall space was
filled with bookcases, and there must have been many
thousand volumes. A gallery at a height of around
twelve feet ran completely around the room. Even
this was filled with books. The furniture was simple.
Near the door stood a safe, and there were a number
of stands in various corners. But in the center of the
room was the largest desk I had ever seen—a huge
affair made out of an old-fashioned square piano—with
its surface littered with books and papers. Near it
stood a typewriter stand, with the machine uncovered.
And then, suddenly, we saw something
else—something which drove all other thoughts from our minds.
Peering from behind the desk was a foot—a foot which
did not move.</p>

<p>We must have seen it at the same moment, for
Carter's hand gripped my arm, and for a second we stood
silent. Then without a word slowly we went across
the floor, knowing what we would find. Though we
were sure what was behind the desk, yet it came as a
shock. For there, lying on his back upon the
floor—with both arms outstretched from the body—lay a
man. A man to whom the dinner waiting in the big
house would never matter; and it needed but a glance
to know that death had come suddenly—and violently.</p>

<p>As Ranville's eyes and mine met, they framed the
same question. It was Carter who spoke the two
words:</p>

<p>“It's Warren.”</p>

<p>The scientist was a man of about fifty, and perhaps
a little over that age. The face was self-willed, and the
lines around the distorted lips were stern. Though
past middle life, his hair was a dense black, without a
sign of gray, and there was not a white hair in the
close-cropped mustache. One could tell by his figure that he
had been a man of the strongest physique. He was
dressed in a light summer suit, without a coat, and upon
the white shirt, just over the heart, was a crimson stain.</p>

<p>Carter dropped on his knees and made a hasty
examination. In a second he turned and pointed with
his finger at the dark stain upon the white shirt. Then
as he straightened up we saw something
else—something we had overlooked. It was a sheet of paper.
Evidently it had fallen off the body, though perhaps it
had been placed by its side. A piece of bond paper
with but five letters—large letters, evidently written
with a hurried hand, the beginning of an incompleted
word:</p>

<blockquote class="paper">

  <p>—ANANI—</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There had been little conversation, for we were too
upset by what we had found. But the piece of paper
puzzled us. That Warren had been stabbed there was
no doubt; but what the paper meant we could not tell.
The letters seemed to mean nothing, and we were not
sure that they had anything to do with the crime. For
a moment we puzzled over it, and then my eyes
wandered again to the still figure upon the floor. As I
glanced at it, I gave a sudden start and dropped to my
knees for a closer look. And then—then, after one
glance, I gave a startled cry.</p>

<p>For there upon the forehead of the murdered man
were two faint lines—lines now swollen and red. Not
very long lines, nor for that matter very noticeable, but
lines which I could not understand. There upon
the forehead of the famous scientist were two faint
lines cut into the skin. A cross—the lines of which
had just been made. Cut faintly, I judged, with a knife.
A cross—the lines now red and swollen, and a crooked
cross at that.</p>

<h2>Chapter III. <br> The Broken Bookcase</h2>

<p>At my cry of astonishment Carter and Ranville had
turned in surprise. I simply pointed to the forehead
of the murdered man, and they bent forward for a
closer look. I saw a startled expression sweep over the
Englishman's face, and he slowly shook his head. It
was Carter who broke the silence, speaking to no one
in particular.</p>

<p>“Do you think that was made by the murderer?”</p>

<p>“There is not the slightest doubt of it,” was
Ranville's quick retort. “That man has not been dead over
two hours, and the cut itself is not any older.”</p>

<p>I cast a hurried glance at the grewsome lines of the
red cross and gave a little shiver as I asked:</p>

<p>“But what under heavens can it mean; why should
there be a mutilation of that kind?”</p>

<p>Carter simply shook his head, and it was the
Scotland Yard Inspector who replied:</p>

<p>“We do not know, of course. I have seen a good
many murdered people in my time, but as a rule the
murderer had never marked his victim. Once in a
while you will run into a murder which was committed
by a woman—committed in a fit of frenzy. Sometimes
in such a case they mark up their victims. But of
course we know nothing of this crime. What the
motive was we do not know. How he was killed is rather
easy to understand—a long thin knife or dagger.”</p>

<p>The body lay upon the floor near the desk, but about
two feet behind it. The position was such that any
one coming into the building by the front door would
have been unable to see it. Save for the crimson spot
upon the shirt and the faint cross upon the forehead,
there were no signs of violence.</p>

<p>But the position in which the body lay was rather
odd. The man lay flat upon his back, the staring eyes
fixed upon the ceiling. But both arms were
outstretched as far as they could reach. It was this that
puzzled me. I knew it was impossible that the man
could have fallen in the position in which he was.
Some one must have arranged the body after the
crime—but why?</p>

<p>Behind the desk was the chair in which the scientist
must have sat while at work. Near it, on the left, was
another chair, back of the typewriting stand. And on
the other side of the desk, very close to it, was a third
chair. The surface of the desk was covered with
papers and pamphlets. A small heap of manuscript was
piled in an orderly manner in the very center. But of
any weapon there was not a sign.</p>

<p>I was just starting to comment upon this when I
observed that Ranville was carefully studying the
position of the chairs. In a moment he went around the
desk, studying the place where a chair stood. Then
he turned to us.</p>

<p>“I have an idea I can reconstruct the murder. See
the three chairs? There is no trouble about the two
on your side of the desk; one was where Warren sat
when at work, the other was for his secretary. But
this chair on my side of the desk tells us a good deal.”</p>

<p>I cast an inquiring gaze at the chair, a tall antique
piece of furniture, while Ranville continued:</p>

<p>“In a room as large as this you will not as a rule
find a chair pulled up to a desk, across from which a
man is working. But if some one comes in, the
natural thing is to bring a chair near the desk, to be as
close to the man you are talking to as you can. Now
there are other chairs in the room across the desk from
where Warren sat; but they are all rather far away.
All but that one, and I am pretty sure the murderer
sat there.”</p>

<p>When he mentioned it, I noticed for the first time
that there were a number of other chairs across from
us. Some were near the wall, and one in front of the
safe; but the chair he was speaking of stood but two
feet from the desk. Seeing we did not speak, he went
on:</p>

<p>“What happened, I think, was this. The murderer
sat in this chair talking to Warren. I have an idea it
was some one he knew. Though I do not know his
habits, yet I doubt if Warren would spend much time
while at work with any one he did not know. The
papers said he was rushing his book. Maybe there
were some words passed, maybe not. But then,
suddenly, Warren was killed.”</p>

<p>“Why suddenly?” came Carter's dry question.</p>

<p>“Warren seems to have been a man of strong
physical development. There is no evidence of any
struggle. In a fight I judge he could have held his own with
any one. So if there was no struggle, it follows he was
killed suddenly. I judge whoever sat in that chair
must have risen—perhaps said he was going—strolled
to Warren's side and suddenly stabbed him.”</p>

<p>I again turned my eyes to the figure upon the floor,
and again the outstretched arms puzzled me.</p>

<p>“But he never fell to the floor in that position,” I
said.</p>

<p>“He never did,” was the reply. “The body was
arranged in that position, and the cut on his forehead was
made after he was dead.”</p>

<p>“But why?” asked Carter.</p>

<p>“God knows!” was the retort. “But then, Carter,
this is not our show anyway.”</p>

<p>Carter gave a sudden start, saying slowly: “You are
right. I will call up our chief of police. He will get a
mighty big shock, for there has not been a murder in
this town in years. And then”—he paused—“then I'd
better call the housekeeper and break the news to
her.”</p>

<p>There was a telephone in the building near the door.
After several attempts Carter got the housekeeper
and told her that she had better come to the summer
house. Then he held a short conversation with the
police station, after which he returned to our side.</p>

<p>“While we are waiting for the police, we had better
look this place over,” he said.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned, the building was an odd one
with eight sides and only one story. There was a
window at each side, placed rather high, and the space
between the windows was filled with bookcases. All
these cases had glass doors, some of which were open,
while others we found locked. The books in the cases
were mostly upon science and anthropology—the
library of a professional scientist. It was not until we
reached the further side of the room that we found
anything out of the way. But there we found one of
the bookcases with the glass in the locked door smashed
into hundreds of pieces—pieces which lay upon the
rug at our feet.</p>

<p>Behind the broken glass were seven book shelves
with books packed tightly together. They were mostly
bound in a uniform red morocco, small volumes, not
very thick nor very tall. Only in the third shelf was
there a gap, and there several books seemed to be
missing.</p>

<p>And the books themselves turned out to be a rather
curious collection, yet when one remembered Warren's
profession, perhaps they were not so out of place as I
first thought. The word “erotic” describes them best,
though several went beyond that. Why a scientist
should wish to have upon his shelf “The Perfumed
Garden,” “The Ananga Ranga,” “Aretino” and others one
could understand. But there were certain other things
in the case which seemed out of place.</p>

<p>Side by side with the classics of the underworld of
literature stood the witty and immoral romances of the
eighteenth century of France. But there were a few
modern books, decidedly pornographic in type, which
flanked the more classical ones. An odd collection at
the best, worth a good deal of money, it is true. But
the oddest thing to explain was why some one had
broken the glass to get at the contents of the case.</p>

<p>The Englishman gave a low whistle, and I saw his
eyebrows raise. Reaching in his hand, it came forth
with a volume. It stood on the shelf which had the
empty space, the one where, if the broken gap told the
truth, several books were missing. He turned the
leaves slowly, shrugged his shoulders at several of the
engravings, and then without a word handed the book
to me. It was the first volume of De Sade's “Justine,”
the first edition with the illustrations. I remembered
once hearing Bartley say that it was the worst book
ever written and very difficult to secure. In turn,
without speaking, I handed the thin volume to Carter
just as Ranville expressed what was in his mind.</p>

<p>“That's not only a pretty rare book, but it is also a
rather rotten one. It looks very much as if some one
smashed the glass in this case to get at the books.
What they took I cannot tell, though it might be the
other volumes of that ‘Justine.’ I cannot understand
why any murderer should want the books. Besides, it's
the French edition, and not every chap reads French,
you know.”</p>

<p>We agreed to this, and placed the book back in the
case. Then climbing a narrow winding stairs, we went
up to the gallery. It ran around the entire length of
the room—a narrow gallery, built evidently to give
more space for books. The walls were lined with
books, thousands of them, of every kind. But there
were no doors or glass before the cases in the gallery.</p>

<p>Nothing had been disturbed so far as we could see.
I glanced over the rail to the floor below, giving a
shudder as my eyes fell upon the still figure by the
desk—the figure with the outstretched arms.</p>

<p>Leaving the gallery, we tried the rear door, finding
as we expected that it was locked. As both doors had
a spring lock, it would have been only necessary for
the murderer to close them when he went out. But
why the windows were down, and also locked, puzzled
us. It had been a warm day, and it hardly seemed
possible that Warren had worked in a room without any
fresh air. We were commenting on this when there
came a voice from the front door, and two men stepped
into the room.</p>

<p>One was a very short man with a vivid red face, and
I could tell by his blue uniform that it was the chief
of police. He was very warm, as if he had been
hurrying, and there was a questioning look in the glance he
gave us. He had a rather kindly face, though it was
not an over-intelligent one, and I decided that he did
not fancy the task before him. The young man with
him he introduced as the coroner, a young man named
Hasty.</p>

<p>The chief held a short conversation with Carter and
then went over to the desk. He came to a sudden halt
by the body, and I saw the look of dismay which swept
over his face. Even the doctor seemed shocked, but
went about his examination at once. When he had
finished, he rose to answer the eager questions of the
chief.</p>

<p>He informed us the man had been dead several
hours, and that he had been stabbed. The blow had
evidently reached the heart, and the scientist must have
died at once. The faint cross on the forehead he could
not explain, but he agreed that it had been made after
death.</p>

<p>“But,” came the heavy voice of the chief, “why
should any one wish to kill Warren? There are very
few people in the town that know him. Though this is
his birthplace, he has been away so long that he has
hardly any friends here. He never cared to bother
much with people.”</p>

<p>He paused to throw a curious look around the room.</p>

<p>“If he was stabbed, where is the weapon?”</p>

<p>We assured him that we had seen no signs of a
weapon, though we had looked the building over.
Carter said he agreed with the chief regarding Warren's
acquaintance in the town. There was no doubt he was
their most distinguished citizen, but he had been away
so many years that few knew him. But why he had
been murdered, or by whom, there was not the
slightest kind of a clew.</p>

<p>The police chief listened, his face growing very long
as Carter went on. Like most police chiefs in small
places, his work was the usual small town routine.
Confronted with a murder, and one as mysterious as
now before him, he did not know what to do. And as
he gave a glance at the body on the floor, I knew that
he was much perplexed.</p>

<p>As Carter and the chief started a low conversation,
Ranville and I went to the desk. No one had looked
at the papers on its surface, and as we started to glance
through them, we found just about what we had
expected. The greater part of them were notes, and as
I read a sentence or two, I could see that they dealt
with Warren's two years' stay in the heart of China.
Many of them had crude drawings of bones and fossils.
But the handwriting was rather bad, and I did not
bother to read more than a few lines.</p>

<p>There were a number of books upon the desk, but
they were mostly scientific works of reference. One
red-covered volume turned out to be a popular mystery
story, and beside it stood one of the adventure story
magazines. A number of typewritten sheets, evidently
corrected work of his secretary were near the edge of
the desk, the pages filled with corrections in red ink.
But there was nothing of importance, only the natural
data of a scientist who was writing an account of his
last expedition.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to turn away from the desk, my
eyes fell upon a piece of paper which was peering out
from under the typewritten manuscript. I pulled it
forth to see what it might be. It was part of a
typewritten letter dated the day before, but with no address
or signature. There could not have been a signature,
for the lower half of the letter was missing. The sheet
was torn across as if some one had wished to destroy
the signature. It read:</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p class="dateline">“Tuesday.</p>
  <p class="salutation">“Mr. Henry Warren,</p>
  <p class="salutation">“My dear Professor,</p>

  <p>“I will call upon you to-morrow around five o'clock.
  I feel sure you can spare me a few moments. If I can
  only make you see how great a thing you can do for
  humanity, I am sure you will take my viewpoint. The
  consequences of the step you are taking are so
  momentous that unless—”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And there the letter ended, for the rest of the sheet
had been torn off.</p>

<p>It was a curious sort of a letter, and seemed to
contain a warning of some sort. It was written upon a
typewriter whose ribbon was far from clean. Not only
did it contain a warning, but it seemed to me there was
a threat in the words. But more important than
anything else was the statement that the writer would call
upon Warren. As it had been written the day before,
Warren must have seen the person only an hour before
he died.</p>

<p>Without a word I handed the letter to Ranville and
watched his face as he read. When he came to the
end, I saw his eyebrows raise a little, and he turned to
me.</p>

<p>“This looks important, Pelt. Any signs of the
missing portion of the sheet?”</p>

<p>I shook my head, and we both turned to the desk.
We went through every paper, lifting them from each
other, and even turning the pages of the books. But
we found nothing. Then we turned our attention to
the wastebasket, turning the contents upon a small rug.
But the basket contained only the discarded notes
which had been thrown aside and a few matches. The
missing half of the letter we did not find.</p>

<p>As we paused, I noticed that the chief and Carter
were before the bookcase—the bookcase with the
broken glass. Ranville placed the letter in his pocket
and said: “What do you make of it?”</p>

<p>I told him what I thought, that it contained both a
warning and a threat, and then said that it looked as
if the missing part had been taken in order to destroy
the signature.</p>

<p>“True enough,” came the drawling answer. “But
why did they not take the entire letter? Why destroy
half of it and leave the other? If the whole note had
been taken we would never have known anything about
it. To take but half seems a very illogical thing to
do.”</p>

<p>Hearing our voices, Carter and the chief came to
the desk and asked what we had found. Ranville
handed him the letter, and after they had both looked
at it the chief held it a long while in his hand. His
face was a study, and he slowly shook his head. He
might have spoken if Carter had not said:</p>

<p>“The chief agrees with me that the murder of
Professor Warren is going to make a great deal of
comment. He will have the inquest to-morrow, and hopes
before then to have something to go on. As it stands
now all we know is that Warren was murdered, but
nothing else. The—”</p>

<p>There came a commotion at the door, and we turned,
only to see the housekeeper rush into the building.
Her face was red as if she had been running, but why
she had taken so long to come to the library after
Carter called up I could not tell. For a second she
leaned against the door as if out of breath, and then
gave a quick glance around the room. In her eyes was
terror, and the glance at length rested upon Carter.
With one step in his direction, she gasped in a
trembling voice so low that we could barely hear her:</p>

<p>“Mr. Warren—is—is he dead?”</p>

<p>Carter nodded, and again the woman's eyes swept
the room. This time they went slowly as if seeking
for something, and as if afraid of what she might find.
Suddenly she stiffened into attention as her glance fell
upon the foot of the dead man, which could be seen
around the desk. Then slowly, a step at a time, she
crossed the floor to a place beyond the desk. There
she stood, silently looking down at the still figure of
her employer. The red had faded from her cheeks,
and her face was a dull white. Slowly she turned, her
eyes asking the question before her lips spoke:</p>

<p>“Was he murdered?” came the quivering voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” some one said.</p>

<p>For a moment she did not speak. Again her eyes
came back to the silent figure. For an instant as her
lips moved I thought she would speak, but she gave
a shudder and shut them tightly. But the flush had
come back to her face, and when she turned toward us,
I could see the veins in her forehead throb. And then
suddenly, in a shrill voice which rang through the room,
she shrieked: “I knew it, I knew it. It's that
secretary. I knew that girl would—”</p>

<p>But the sentence was not completed. As the shrill
voice rose higher and higher, her hands began to beat
the air; the voice died away in her throat as if
suddenly cut off. Then with a little gasp she staggered a
second and fell fainting to the floor.</p>

<h2>Chapter IV. <br> We Discuss the Crime</h2>

<p>So unexpected was the woman's action that for a
second none of us stirred. It was the doctor who reached
her first. The eyes opened with a little flutter, and the
color came flooding back into her cheeks. As he placed
her in a chair, her hands went out in a confused,
questioning gesture, as if seeking aid. Then when she
realized what had happened, she cast one horrified look in
the direction of the body.</p>

<p>When she was feeling more composed, the chief tried
to question her. But she refused to say a word.
Before she fainted, in a voice which rang with conviction,
she had practically accused the secretary of the
murder. Now in a listless tone she refused to say a
word, shutting her thin lips in a determined manner.
At last, seeing that she did not care to speak, and in
fact would not, the chief suggested that the coroner
assist her back to the house.</p>

<p>When they had left, he turned with an astonished air
to Carter.</p>

<p>“What in the devil did she mean by that crack about
the secretary?”</p>

<p>“I don't know,” was his reply. “She seemed to be
a bit angry. Who is the secretary anyway?”</p>

<p>“Why it's the former stenographer of Judge
Williams. She is as good looking a girl as you will find in
many a day. But that housekeeper is crazy if she
thinks that girl killed Warren.”</p>

<p>“Well,” came the drawling voice of Ranville, “I know
nothing about the girl you speak of; but if I were you,
I would look her up.”</p>

<p>A few moments later, concluding that we could do
no good if we remained, we left. It was growing late,
and the police had much work to do. Besides we were
beginning to feel the need of the dinner we had not
eaten. We told the chief all we knew, showed him the
broken glass in the bookcase, and mentioned what the
housekeeper had said regarding the visit of a
Chinaman. Last of all we pointed out the faint cross on
Warren's forehead. This seemed to impress him more
than anything else, and I saw his eyes grow big. Then
with Carter's remark, that we would aid him in any
manner he wished, we said “good night” and went out.</p>

<p>The stars were bright above our heads, but it was
dark at that. The path between the hedges was a dense
black line, and the trees loomed in a somber manner
above us. Reaching the lawn before the house, we saw
that the building was a blaze of lights, though we
glimpsed no one. We did not turn to the house, but
instead passed through the iron gateway and out to the
road.</p>

<p>No one spoke, and I judged that none of us felt like
speaking. As we went along, I thought of the famous
scientist, who only a few short weeks before had been
hailed in every paper of the world. There had been
many wild guesses made as to what he found, more so
after he had said that the question of man's origin was
forever settled. What he had found no one knew, and
he refused to say, simply stating that it would all come
out in his book. And then the whole controversy burst
into flame.</p>

<p>This was caused by the theological argument which
was raging over evolution. The controversy had
increased after Warren's statement. Back and forth
flew the arguments. The scientists contented
themselves by saying that every intelligent person believed
in evolution, and that if Warren said he had found the
final proof that settled it. His reputation and word
was enough for the men of science. On the other hand,
theologians and demagogues who knew nothing about
science cried long and loud that Warren could not
have found any proofs of evolution, for, as they said,
evolution was not a fact.</p>

<p>In all this controversy—one which filled many pages
of the papers—Warren bore no part. As soon as he
arrived in America, he had gone directly to his home
and made the announcement that he would have his
manuscript ready as soon as possible. Only one
statement he gave the papers—it was to repeat what he
had said before: that he had found the final proofs.
The proofs which settled for all time the question of
man's origin. After that he was silent. And now he
was murdered, and I pictured the papers when they
heard of his death.</p>

<p>And then I began to wonder why he should have
been killed. A man of his decided personality must,
of course, have made enemies. I puzzled over the man
from China, who the housekeeper said had come to
the house. I played with this thought for a while, only
to decide that perhaps it was better to stop wondering
about the case until I had more facts to puzzle over.
And by the time we came in sight of Carter's home the
only thing I was thinking about was something to eat.</p>

<p>The tall grandfather's clock was striking eleven as
we entered the living room. With the remark that we
must be hungry, Carter went out into the kitchen
saying he would see if the cook had left anything in the ice
box. Ranville and myself dropped into the nearest
chairs. I was too tired to talk, and the experiences of
the last few hours had not been pleasant. But to look
at the Scotland Yard Inspector one would never have
guessed that anything had taken place. The fine face
of the Englishman was as peaceful and contented as
if he had just returned from a wedding—instead of a
murder. He lay back in his chair, his eyes half closed,
watching the curling smoke of his cigarette.</p>

<p>Carter's voice hailed us from the kitchen, and we
rose and joined him. Upon the white enameled table
was a cold chicken, three bottles of ale, and some rye
bread. We pulled our chairs to the table and set to
work. When the chicken had become but a memory,
Carter rummaged in the ice box and found a pie—a pie
of which we did not leave a crumb.</p>

<p>The lunch over, we went out on the large veranda;
the night was cool, with a slight breeze, and down at
the edge of the lawn we could hear the water lapping
on the shore. As Carter handed me a cigar, I
happened to think of Trouble, locked in the garage, and
went down to rescue him. He greeted me with a loud
bark, but at my command followed to the piazza and
dropped by the side of my chair. For a while nothing
was said, and in the darkness I watched the glowing
tips of my friends' cigars. It was Carter who broke
the silence, saying to no one in particular:</p>

<p>“Well—what do you think about the murder?”</p>

<p>Ranville's drawling voice came floating from his
chair, and his tone was serious:</p>

<p>“It looks to me, Carter, as if we had stumbled upon
what will prove one of the most perplexing murder
mysteries we have ever seen. There are some very
curious things about this affair; and it's my idea it's
going to prove rather difficult to solve.”</p>

<p>“It will cause a sensation all right,” was the reply.
“You know for weeks Warren's name has been on the
front pages of the papers. First there came the
accounts of his trip to China. When he did not return
at the time expected, the papers began to say his
expedition was lost. Then the outlaw war broke in
China, and it was thought he was killed; and when he
suddenly made his appearance, he certainly got a lot
of publicity.”</p>

<p>As he paused, I added my bit. I reminded them that
his statement that he had settled the question of
evolution had made more comment than anything else.</p>

<p>“That's right,” replied the Englishman. “Even in
London the old <i>Times</i> gave a good many columns to
that feature. But as he refused to say what it was he
had found, the whole affair led to some little
controversy.”</p>

<p>“You have had a good deal of experience in murder
cases in your Scotland Yard work,” I said to the
Inspector. “What do you think was back of Warren's
death?”</p>

<p>Ranville was silent a while, replying at last:</p>

<p>“That is the question. It is pretty hard to say from
what we found to-night, just what could be the motive.
Men are murdered as a rule for three reasons—robbery,
revenge, or, say, in a sudden passion. Now it does not
look like robbery, for we saw no signs of anything
being taken. That is, unless we figure the murderer
broke the glass of the bookcase and took a book. But
that seems hardly reasonable.”</p>

<p>“Still some one did take a book or two from that
case,” was my retort.</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Of course Warren might have broken
the glass himself by accident. Then again, though I
do not know much about books, I do know a bit about
that kind of literature. Once in a while we clean up
some book dealers who put it out in London. And I
know this. None of that stuff sells at a very high
figure. It's rare, of course, mostly because it's sold under
cover. But a few pounds would buy anything in that
case. It does not seem reasonable to start out by
assuming he was murdered for a book of that class.”</p>

<p>“Well, let's put that out of the question and say
revenge,” suggested Carter.</p>

<p>“That would look more reasonable,” Ranville
commented. “A man of Warren's type would, of course,
have made enemies. And the two odd things about the
murder—the position in which we found the body and
the cross on the forehead—seem to suggest revenge.
You cannot tell what he might have done while he was
in China. He may have made enemies there.”</p>

<p>“That suggests the Chinaman who the housekeeper
says came to the house about six,” was my remark.</p>

<p>“Maybe and maybe not,” was Ranville's quick
retort. “I admit that six o'clock is pretty near the time
Warren was killed. Also, why a Chinaman should wish
to see him is something which must be looked into.
But I have had a good deal of experience with criminal
Chinese in our Limehouse section of London. They
are capable of the most devilish torture, the weirdest
kinds of murder. But I fail to remember a single case
where they ever marked their victim after death. And
no Chinaman, it seems to me, would ever mark his
victim with a cross. Of course, once in a while you run
into one who goes wild, and there is no telling what he
might do. But as a rule, though they will in seeking
revenge impose the most cruel tortures on some of their
victims, they do not as a rule mark them after death.”</p>

<p>“Disfigurement after a killing is often the work of
a frenzied woman,” was Carter's shrewd remark.</p>

<p>“That's true, Carter. Women, far more than men,
are apt not to be satisfied with murder alone. When a
woman in a sudden passion kills a man, she often, while
the rage is on her, goes further.”</p>

<p>“And that makes one think of what the housekeeper
said about the secretary,” was my comment.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, broken by Carter's
saying:</p>

<p>“I wonder what the housekeeper meant by that
remark. She certainly shut up like a clam when we tried
to question her. There is something back of it—at least
back of the housekeeper's attitude.”</p>

<p>“Well,” came Ranville's voice, “there is one thing
sure; I think I am right when I say that whoever
killed Warren was some one who knew him. He sat
in that chair, the one across from the desk, and I think
perhaps I am right when I add that he might have gone
to Warren's side to say good-by and then plunged the
knife into him. But why he paused to arrange the body
on the floor and to make the cross on his forehead I
cannot say, but—”</p>

<p>Just what he might have added I do not know. We
were interrupted by the dog suddenly rising to his feet
and starting to growl. Deep, heavy growls at some
object we could not see. Then came the sound of
footsteps on the walk, and a deep voice came from the
lawn:</p>

<p>“Hearing voices, Mr. Carter, I could not resist
stopping.”</p>

<p>As the man came up the steps, I pushed the dog
behind my chair, telling him to be quiet. Carter rose and
turned on the porch lamp. For a moment the light,
after the dense darkness, blinded me. I wondered who
could be coming to see Carter at this late hour. It was
a very tall and an extremely thin man who accepted
the chair which Carter pulled out. A man with a deep
lined face and nervous shifting eyes. As he came over
to the chair, I saw that he was wearing a clergyman's
collar, though he did not look as calm as most of the
clergymen I have seen.</p>

<p>He proved to be Carter's next-door neighbor, and he
told us he was on his way home when he heard the
sound of our voices. As he talked, I could see that he
was of a nervous, restless disposition, for his hands
were never still, and he moved his feet in an uneasy
manner. His voice was rather harsh, though the
English he used was perfect.</p>

<p>After the introductions had been acknowledged
Carter said:</p>

<p>“Woods is my next-door neighbor. He's been in
England, Ranville.”</p>

<p>The clergyman admitted that he had been in
England many times. He changed the conversation at
once by remarking:</p>

<p>“I have just come from down town, and they are all
excited over the murder of Mr. Warren. I did not
know Warren very well, but it seems almost incredible
a man of his position should have met with such a
sudden death. Have they any idea who the guilty person
is?”</p>

<p>We all shook our heads, and then Carter went into
a brief description of the finding of the body. The
eyes of the minister grew larger as he went on, and I
saw a horrified look sweep across his face. As I did
not know many clergymen, I studied the man before
me with interest. It was easy to see that he had a good
education, and I wondered why he had buried himself
in such a small country town. Long before Carter had
finished I had decided that the minister was as nervous
a man as I have ever met. His hands were never still,
and his eyes were as uneasy as his hands.</p>

<p>He said nothing until Carter mentioned the
secretary, and then half rose as he burst forth:</p>

<p>“Why, of all things,” came the rough high-pitched
voice, “I know Mr. Warren's secretary very well. She
comes to my church. You must know her also—Miss
Harlan?” and he turned to Carter.</p>

<p>Carter shook his head; then said he knew her by
sight and that was all. He added she was a very
fine-looking girl.</p>

<p>“That's very true,” the minister eagerly replied.
“She is not only a very fine-looking girl, but a very fine
girl in all ways. It's absurd to think she knows
anything about Mr. Warren's death. I saw her myself this
afternoon.”</p>

<p>The conversation for some reason lagged after this,
and after a while the minister gave a glance at his
watch, and then with a sudden exclamation rose saying
it was late. We said “good night,” and he went down
the steps and was lost to sight. After he was out of
hearing Ranville asked:</p>

<p>“How long have you taken up with clergymen,
Carter?”</p>

<p>His friend laughed. “Oh, I do not know him so very
well. He has lived here for some time. It seems that
about fifty years ago his grandfather—for some
unknown reason—built the church next door. Woods
sort of fell into it. He has a good deal of money they
say, but very few people ever go to his church. In
fact he supports it himself. You see he is about as
high church as you can find—all sorts of rituals and
that kind of thing. They don't go very well in a place
like this. Then again, he is always attacking
something.”</p>

<p>“Attacking something; what do you mean?” was
Ranville's puzzled question.</p>

<p>Carter laughed. “You do not have very many men
of that type in your country. You see, Woods has but
one duty in life. It is to try and make the rest of us
think and do the things which he believes are right.
Every little while he breaks loose—attacks Sunday
baseball, dances, auto rides on Sunday. I do not know
just how many of those things he is mixed up in. But
I do know that he holds office in most of the more
rabid reform societies in the state and nation. As he
has money and makes heavy contributions, he is sort
of a power in some circles. But his church does not
amount to much here, mostly because no one goes.
Though, after all, it is the most beautiful one we have.
He is an odd duck at the best.”</p>

<p>He rose with this and turned off the light, For
a while we sat in the darkness smoking, no one
speaking. I begun to feel sleepy and wanted to hint that
it was time to go to bed. Once in a while the dog at my
side gave a little sigh of contentment. And then, just
as Carter started to suggest that it was time we retired,
Ranville gave a little laugh and said:</p>

<p>“You know I have been thinking about this murder.
There is no doubt about the sensation it will make.
Your police chief, it seems to me, will have far more
on his shoulders than he can manage.”</p>

<p>“For once in your life you spoke the truth,” was
Carter's dry comment.</p>

<p>“Righto,” was the cheery response, “and I have been
thinking—” and the Englishman paused.</p>

<p>“That's twice you have been thinking, Ranville,” was
Carter's reply. “Suppose you tell us what you were
thinking about.”</p>

<p>“Just this. Here are the three of us, all engaged in
some sort or another of criminal work. You are with
the Secret Service, Carter. Pelt is the right-hand man
of your big expert, Bartley, and I am with Scotland
Yard. Why should we not take a hand in the case?”</p>

<p>“What for?” growled Carter. “Good Lord, man,
don't you know this is my first vacation in four years?
And it's your first in some time. Of course Pelt here
never does much work anyway.”</p>

<p>I started to protest, but Ranville gave me no time to
speak.</p>

<p>“Well, Carter,” he said, “I would like to keep close
to this affair. It would give me some idea of how you
work in this country.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, Ranville,” protested his friend. “Where
do you think you are? This is a small country town.
How do you think this will be handled? In England
you would call in the Yard, with their fingerprint
experts, photographers, microscopes, and with hundreds
of men in every part of England working under one
department. We have nothing of the kind in this
country. If this case is ever solved, it will be by what we
call ‘bull luck.’ ”</p>

<p>“True enough,” came the cheerful response. “But
this is going to be one of the famous murder cases of
the century. You want to remember Warren is one of
the best-known scientists in the world. And he was
murdered, you know. I thought we might take a little
hand in it. Sort of play along, as you say in America,
with the police.”</p>

<p>There was a more interested tone in Carter's voice
as he asked:</p>

<p>“What do you propose?”</p>

<p>“Just this. Suppose we divide things. Let us start
with the visit of the Chinaman. Some one must find
out about him. Now I have had extensive dealings
with them; suppose I look into that end. You follow
what new developments came out at the inquest, for
there are always developments at such hearings. You
know the chief and can work with him.”</p>

<p>“What shall I look after?” was my eager question.</p>

<p>Carter anticipated his friend by saying:</p>

<p>“You being the youngest, Pelt, and as I once heard
John Bartley say—young and romantic—can look into
the matter of the secretary. We have been told she is
good to look at.”</p>

<p>I started to reply, but Ranville gave me no time.</p>

<p>“Really,” he said, “I am serious. This case is going
to be a sensational affair before it is over. And if we
all take a hand in it, we can save time. Your police
chief will need all the aid he can get before it is over.”</p>

<p>Carter rose to his feet, and his voice came floating
down to us out of the darkness.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it's all right. But I never knew it
to fail. Every time Pelt goes anywhere in the summer
he brings a murder. It happened that way last year
and the year before. All you have to do is invite Pelt
to visit you, and you can be pretty sure some one will
be found dead within a few hours after he arrives.
Sometimes I even wonder if he kills them himself. But
I will agree with you, though I have but one suggestion
to make, Ranville—”</p>

<p>“What might that be?” came the question.</p>

<p>“A very simple one. That we go to bed; it is now
after one?” And with that he started into the house.
A moment later we rose and followed him.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch05">

<h2>Chapter V. <br> The Inquest</h2>

<p>Ten o'clock the next morning found us crossing the
village green. In front of us was the Court House,
where the inquest was to be held, its front steps filled
with people. Cars were parked along the streets and
were arriving every second. There was no doubt the
sudden death of Warren had proven to be the greatest
sensation of many years and people were coming from
all directions to hear what the inquest might bring
forth.</p>

<p>We pushed our way through the crowd on the Court
House steps and into the building. The inquest was to
be held on the second floor, and the steps leading to the
room were crowded. I doubt if we would have been
able to get through the people if it had not been for one
of the village policemen, who, recognizing Carter,
managed to get us to the second floor. And even here the
hallway was filled. When we succeeded in getting into
the court room, it was to find people standing along the
walls.</p>

<p>In some manner the chief recognized us in the
crowd and beckoned for us to come to the front of the
room. After much pushing, we reached the rail which
divided the spectators from the space reserved for the
court officials. Behind it we found three chairs had
been reserved for us. Behind the desk where the judge
sat when Court was in session was the coroner, who
gave us a half smile of greeting. The chief came over
to our side, and in reply to a question from Carter, if
he had discovered anything new, shook his head.</p>

<p>The court room was packed to overflowing—an
uneasy mass of men, whose eyes showed the excitement
they were under. Over the room hung the low murmur
of whispers, and the few women in the place gazed
eagerly around.</p>

<p>Though all space was taken, and people were even
standing two deep along the walls, yet at the door late
arrivals were trying to crowd their way into the room.
The murder had brought them out—that strange streak
of cruelty or morbidness which is in so many people.
I saw Ranville give the place a curious look, and knew
that he was thinking of similar scenes in England.</p>

<p>The sheriff, a tall, heavy-set man, rose and announced
that no more people would be allowed in the room and
requested that those present be silent while the
inquest was on. And then, within the next ten minutes,
the jury was chosen. It took but a little time to secure
them, for they simply called twelve men—men who
filed into the jury box with a very serious air, and men
who also seemed secretly well pleased at the place of
importance which was given.</p>

<p>In rapid succession Carter, Ranville and myself
went on the stand and told the story of our finding of
the body. Ranville's announcement that he was an
Inspector of Scotland Yard created a good deal of
comment, and I heard whispers go around the room. But
our testimony was of little importance, for we had
nothing new that we could tell. When I stepped down
from the stand, the coroner looked at the papers on his
desk, then motioned to the chief and after a moment's
whispered conversation called the name of the
housekeeper, Mrs. Lawrence.</p>

<p>The housekeeper went slowly to the chair and seated
herself with a tired air. For some reason she was
wearing black, and her red face was stern as she turned
to face the coroner. She was far from being a
good-looking woman, and I judged as I looked at her that
she had a temper. The mouth was small, and the
narrow lips were set in a stern thin line. Ranville gave her
one look and leaned over me to say: “She has got
her back up over something.”</p>

<p>Her first statements had to do with Warren's
household. She had been his housekeeper for some years,
living in the house when he was out of the country.
I judged she thought that her long years of service had
given her a place of authority, for she spoke as if she
had complete reign over the household. When he
returned from China, she had secured a cook and a maid
and there was also a man working around the grounds.
She told us it was Warren's practice to work in his
library during the afternoon and that he had dinner
about seven o'clock.</p>

<p>“Did he work there alone?” asked the coroner.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; his secretary, Florence Harlan, was there
with him.”</p>

<p>She paused a moment and then went on to say that
she understood that Mr. Warren was writing a book,
though she was not sure. All visitors to the house
afternoons were told to go to the library. There had
not, however, been many people to see him the last few
days.</p>

<p>“Now,” came the coroner's voice. “Suppose you tell
us just what you were doing yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the woman, “Mr. Warren had told
me Mr. Carter and two friends were coming to dinner.
I arranged the dinner with the cook and spent part of
the afternoon getting the dining room ready. About
seven o'clock Mr. Carter came with his friends. I was
getting rather worried then.”</p>

<p>“What were you worried over?”</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, then went on. “Mr.
Warren had not come to the house. He always stopped
working about six and dressed for dinner. But when
it got after six, I called the library. In fact, I called it
on the phone several times, but I received no reply.
Then I went out of the house, and, going to the library,
knocked on the door. No one answered. But—” She
paused.</p>

<p>A murmur started around the room as they waited
for her next words. She paused and continued:</p>

<p>“But I thought I heard a sound in the library.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by a sound?” was the
question.</p>

<p>She hesitated as if not sure of her words, then said:</p>

<p>“It's hard to say. It was just as I started to reach
my hand for the knocker upon the door. A sound hard
to describe, like a chair being pushed across the floor,
or like glass breaking; I am not sure.”</p>

<p>I gave a quick glance at Ranville, who sat with his
head on one side looking at the witness. His face was
calm, yet there was an interested look in his eyes. Like
breaking glass the woman had said, and I thought of
the broken door of the bookcase. I remembered that
both Carter and his friend had thought it absurd that
the murderer should have had anything to do with the
broken door of the bookcase. But at the woman's
words I began to wonder if they were right.</p>

<p>“What did you do after you heard this noise?”</p>

<p>“It was hardly what you would call a noise,”
retorted the woman. “It was very faint, but I thought I
heard something. I knocked on the door then, but no
one answered. The door was locked.”</p>

<p>“Was it Mr. Warren's habit to have his door locked
when working in his library?” asked the coroner.</p>

<p>“I never knew him to lock it, sir. It was a fairly
warm day, and Mr. Warren since he has been in China
and South America liked plenty of heat.”</p>

<p>The coroner glanced at some notes he had, then
asked:</p>

<p>“Did any one come to the house during the
afternoon—any one who wanted to see Mr. Warren?”</p>

<p>The woman's voice was eager as she replied: “Yes,
sir, a Chinaman.”</p>

<p>The room stirred as one person and I could see the
people bend forward for the next question.</p>

<p>“What did you mean by your last answer?”</p>

<p>“Just a little before six the door bell rang. When I
went to the door there was a Chinaman there. He wore
a white suit and asked for Mr. Warren. I told him
where the library was and showed him how to get there.
He thanked me and went up the walk to the building.”</p>

<p>“Did you see him again?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I did not see him again. I never saw him
before for that matter. He did not give any name.”</p>

<p>To my great surprise the chief and the coroner held
a brief conversation, talking in a very low tone. When
it was over the woman was excused. What surprised
me was that she had not been asked about her
statement in the library regarding the secretary. Then, in
a sudden frenzy, she had almost accused the girl of
murdering the scientist. The chief had heard what she
said and the doctor who was the coroner had heard it,
but they had not asked her a single question. And I
wondered.</p>

<p>Then the doctor made a short statement, saying that
Warren had been killed by either a dagger or a thin
knife. The blow had struck the heart and he had died
at once. The explanation was made in short, concise
sentences without the usual medical terminology. He
closed by saying that he must have been dead around
two hours when he saw him. As that was some time
after eight Warren had been killed between six and
half past.</p>

<p>The next witness proved to be the man that worked
around Warren's place. The gardener was the usual
type of a workman, rather dull, with a heavy,
uninteresting face. He announced somewhat loudly that he
knew nothing about the murder and said that he had
not known that his master was dead until he heard the
news in the village late in the evening. When asked
about the Chinaman, he replied that he had not seen
him. Most of the afternoon he had been working in
the garden, which, I judged from his testimony, was so
placed that he could not see the library. It seemed as
if his testimony was to be of no importance when, just
after he had been excused, the coroner called him back
to ask if he had seen any one around the library.</p>

<p>He stumbled back into his seat and thought a
moment, then said:</p>

<p>“Can't say that I did. But when I was going to the
house after the six o'clock whistle blew, I saw
something. Don't think it is of any importance.”</p>

<p>“What was it?” was the question.</p>

<p>“Well,” came the slow reply, “I came down by the
library, and I seen a rowboat going round the bend of
the point. Did not see the person in it because the
boat was just getting out of sight.”</p>

<p>The coroner suggested he could not swear that the
boat had come from Warren's shore, and was surprised
by having the man say he was pretty sure it had. But
why he was sure of this he was unable to say, and
though the doctor pressed him to explain, he could not.
He left the stand having given, as far as I could see,
no evidence of any importance.</p>

<p>Again the coroner and the chief held a short
conversation. Then the doctor surprised us by saying
that the inquest would be adjourned until after lunch.
As it was only eleven-thirty this seemed rather odd,
for there was still time to hear another witness. As it
was, the morning session had been of little value.
Nothing had been brought out that we did not know, and
the testimony of the gardener regarding the row boat
seemed of little worth. He was not sure the boat had
come from Warren's shore line.</p>

<p>The crowd filed out with a great deal of noise. They
seemed to be a bit disappointed. There had been no
spectacular revelations, nothing sensational. Just the
bald recital of the murder and nothing more. One
could tell by their talk, and the shaking of heads, that
the inquest had not proven what they expected. And
after they had all gone out we went to the car and
drove back to Carter's for an early lunch.</p>

<p>Lunch was a rather quiet affair and it was not until
we had gone out on the veranda for our smoke that any
one mentioned the inquest. Then, when we had settled
back in our chairs to enjoy the thirty minutes which
remained before our return to the Court House, I asked
what they thought of the morning session.</p>

<p>Carter, watching the smoke from his cigar as it
curled away in the breeze, replied:</p>

<p>“Well, Pelt. It was not productive of any
information. The most remarkable thing to me was the fact
they did not ask that housekeeper a single question
about the secretary. After her remarks last evening
one would have expected that they would have been
followed up.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea,” said Ranville, “they may have
saved that for this afternoon. There was only one
thing that interested me.”</p>

<p>“What was that?” I asked.</p>

<p>There was a thoughtful look on his face as he
replied:</p>

<p>“The statement of the gardener about some one in a
boat.”</p>

<p>“Why, you don't think there was anything in that?”
was my surprised comment. “He did not even know
if the boat had come from Warren's shore.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” drawled the Englishman. “You want to
remember that so far there has been no evidence of
any one who had been to the house except the
Chinaman. Now the housekeeper says she heard some one
in the library just as she knocked on the door; heard
the glass break. Perhaps she did, and if so, I have an
idea that Warren had already been killed, and maybe
she heard the murderer.”</p>

<p>“But, good God, Ranville,” came Carter's disgusted
voice, “that means you think the murderer smashed
the glass to steal a book. I cannot believe that
Warren was killed for a fool erotic book.”</p>

<p>“I do not say that he was killed for a book. In fact
I have grave doubts if the murderer even took the
books. But he may have smashed that case by
accident. What I was getting at is simply this. You have
the Chinaman who went to the library. No one saw
him come back. You have that farm-hand, or
whatever you call him, who saw the boat. Now did the
Chinaman go away in a boat he found on the shore or
was it some one else?”</p>

<p>For a few moments we discussed this, reaching in
the end no agreement. Of one thing we were certain.
It was that, save for the Chinaman, there had been no
evidence of any one going to the library during the
afternoon. But what the testimony of the man who
had charge of the grounds could mean we were not
sure. There was no way of telling if the boat had
come from Warren's shore or not. And then with a
hurried glance at his watch Carter ended the
argument by saying we had just time to reach the Court
House before the afternoon session opened.</p>

<p>We found the room again filled and had just time to
take our chairs as the jury filed back into the box.
Then, with one glance around the room, the coroner
recalled the housekeeper to the stand. As she took
her chair she seemed very much surprised as if she
had not expected to testify again. With a look at a
paper which he held in his hand the coroner asked the
first question.</p>

<p>“You told us this morning that Mr. Warren worked
every afternoon in his library. Did his secretary work
with him?”</p>

<p>The woman nodded and then said: “Yes.”</p>

<p>The coroner went on: “What time did she return to
the house yesterday afternoon?”</p>

<p>I saw a strange look flit across the woman's face
and she replied: “Around four o'clock.”</p>

<p>“Was that her usual time to return?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. As a rule she worked until five and often
until seven.”</p>

<p>“And did she give any reason for her return at this
early hour?”</p>

<p>The woman's face flushed a little and then she said:</p>

<p>“No, sir. That is, she did not say why she was back
so early, but I was surprised to see her—more so
because of what she did.”</p>

<p>There came a silence in the room and the low
whispers that one could hear after each statement died
away. The coroner, who seemed to know just what
the woman would testify, asked:</p>

<p>“You say, ‘What she did.’ What do you mean?”</p>

<p>The housekeeper had been speaking in a low voice
without any apparent show of emotion. Now she
raised her head, and her voice was quick and
impulsive as she replied:</p>

<p>“I was in the living room when the secretary
returned. She rushed in the front door and ran upstairs.
She lived at the house. I thought that she had gone to
her room for something. I thought nothing of this
until a few moments later she came downstairs; in her
hand was her suit case.”</p>

<p>“Her suit case?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And she seemed very excited. Her face was
flushed and when I spoke to her she was very angry.”</p>

<p>“What did you say to her?”</p>

<p>“Why, naturally, I asked her where she was going.
Seeing the suit case and knowing that it was not time
for Mr. Warren to stop work, I wondered what had
happened.” She paused, and as she did not continue,
the coroner asked:</p>

<p>“Well, what did she say?”</p>

<p>The woman was silent a moment then replied:</p>

<p>“She banged the suit case down on the floor and
said, ‘I am going away. You can tell Mr. Warren I
won't do any more work for him.’ ” Again she
hesitated, as if holding something back. Once more the
coroner had to request her to finish her statement. She
raised her head, sweeping the court room with a
glance, and then her eyes came back to the coroner.
Again he barked out:</p>

<p>“What did she say?”</p>

<p>“She said,” was the slow reply, “Mr. Warren ought
to be killed. He ought to be killed.”</p>

<p>A murmur of astonishment went around the room,
and I saw from the coroner's face that the answer was
unexpected. There had been nothing of value until
the present testimony, and now, all at once, there had
come into the crowded room the ringing of a threat.
I saw Carter shift in his chair and he bent forward and
whispered something in the Englishman's ear. But
what it was I did not know. And then after a
moment of surprise the coroner tried to gain more
information from his witness.</p>

<p>But she had told him all she knew. She said the
secretary had been very angry, and that her voice had
risen when she made her remark “that Warren ought to
be killed.” But why she had said this she could not
tell. The girl, a moment later, had picked up her suit
case and left the house. She had watched her from a
front window and saw her go out to the road. Where
she had gone, or the reason for her action, she did not
know. And though the coroner asked her many
questions yet he gained nothing in return; for the woman
knew of no reason why the secretary should have left
the house or above all why she had made the remark
that she did.</p>

<p>When she left the stand there was a different
atmosphere about the inquest. We had spent the morning in
getting nowhere. Now all at once there had come a
mystery—the mystery of why the secretary should
have rushed into the house for her bag, why she had
left, and, above all, the reason for her statement against
her employer.</p>

<p>In rapid succession two policemen followed one
another on the stand. They testified that they had spent
the morning trying to find the secretary, but to no avail.
Before she had gone to Warren's home to work she
had roomed in a house kept by an aunt. But the aunt
had not seen her for several days and they had found
no trace of her anywhere. She simply had walked out
of Warren's yard and vanished. They told of asking
the drivers of several of the bus lines if they had had
the girl as a passenger. But though she was very well
known in the village no one had seen her.</p>

<p>When they left the stand, the inquest broke down,
simply for the fact there were no more witnesses to call.
Warren had been killed, and it was the only fact the
police could prove. But why he had been killed, or
any evidence which might have thrown any light upon
his death, they did not have. It had proven about as
barren an inquest as I had ever attended. The only
thing of interest had been the unexpected testimony
regarding the secretary, and her foolish statement that
Warren ought to be killed. But even that by itself was
not evidence of much value.</p>

<p>The chief and the coroner held a long whispered
conversation, during which the policeman several times
shook his head. Then, gathering his papers together,
the coroner arose and, going into a short account of the
murder, gave the case to the jury. They filed out
through a door behind the judge's desk, a very
perplexed-looking group of men, and we settled back to
await their return.</p>

<p>We did not have a long wait. As the door closed
behind the twelve men, the room had broken into excited
whispers, but they died away, when within ten minutes
they returned to their chairs. They wore a rather
serious look, and upon the face of every man was an air
of importance. Then the foreman arose and very
soberly said that they agreed. In a few words he gave
the only verdict which could be rendered: “Death at
the hands of a person or persons unknown.”</p>

<p>There came the scraping of feet, the pushing back
of chairs and the sound of excited voices. The inquest
was over.</p>

<h2>Chapter VI. <br> I Have an Adventure</h2>

<p>Carter had mentioned at lunch that after the
inquest he was going to take his car and give Ranville
a ride through the near-by country. As the route he had
mapped out was the one I had come over the day
before, I suggested it would please me just as well if they
left me at the house. So, after speaking to his cook
about my dinner, they drove out of the yard. I let
the dog out of the garage, where he had been the entire
day, and settled down on the veranda to read the New
York papers which had just come.</p>

<p>The news of the murder of Warren must have
arrived very late, for they had only a few lines about it.
But then, when I thought it over, that was all the space
they needed. A very few lines could tell all that was
actually known of the crime. But there were long
accounts of his professional career, and even a short
editorial telling what a loss he would be to science.
Naturally enough the question was raised, if his
manuscripts were in such shape that the discoveries he had
hinted he made in China could be given the world.</p>

<p>As I read the various articles, I saw that this one
question was of the greatest interest to the public.
Warren had said that he could prove for all time the
question of man's origin. But what his proofs were no
one knew. As he was a real scientist he refused to say
anything more until he had whipped his notes into
shape for publication and could give the complete data
to the world. And the three papers which I read all
asked the same question. Were these notes in such
condition that they could be worked up by some other
man of science?</p>

<p>I was interrupted by the cook saying that dinner was
ready, and I went into the dining room for my meal.
Dinner over, I went out of the house, and for a time
strolled around the grounds. They covered about an
acre, and after a while I went through the opening in
the hedge and into the quiet street. The road took a
bend by Carter's house, and around it I saw the dark
gray tower of a little church. I walked far enough to
be able to have a view of it, deciding that it must be the
church of which his next-door neighbor (the minister
who had called the night before) had charge.</p>

<p>From where I stood it seemed a very pretty sort of
a building, with a stone tower directly between the
church and the rectory. It was not very large, nor was
the tower very high. It stood back from the road, with
a vivid green lawn running to the dark granite walls—a
lawn with several round flower beds, a mass of color
against the green. The setting of the little church was
beautiful, as if some corner of England had been lifted
and placed in the little New York village.</p>

<p>I had thought I might take a little stroll, but feeling
lazy I returned to the veranda, where, for a while, I
busied myself with a popular magazine. I was in the
midst of an inane story when I was hailed by a voice
from the lawn, and the dog went barking down the
steps.</p>

<p>“Say, mister, where is Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>It was a boy of about fourteen who hailed me—a
boy with the reddest hair I have ever seen and more
freckles than any boy ought to have. He stood at the
bottom of the steps looking at me with a very serious
expression on his face. He seemed so disappointed
when I told him Carter was away that I asked him
what he wanted. For a moment or so he studied me
as if to decide if I could be trusted. Then, as if
reassured, he came up the steps to my side.</p>

<p>Giving me that searching look which all boys use in
greeting people whom they do not know, he asked:</p>

<p>“Are you a detective like Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>I assured him that I might be called something of the
sort and received a rather admiring grin. Then
seating himself on the top step, he patted the dog which
had come to his side and said:</p>

<p>“You know I went down to Court to-day, and I
heard Jimmy Weedon tell about seeing that boat.”</p>

<p>I judged that Weedon must be the caretaker of
Warren's grounds. In reply to my question the boy
said that he was; and with a laugh added:</p>

<p>“Jimmy said that he never saw anybody on Mr.
Warren's grounds yesterday, but I did.”</p>

<p>I gave him one look, and he went on.</p>

<p>“I thought maybe Mr. Carter might like to know
what I saw. I caddy for him when he plays golf. My
name is George.”</p>

<p>He seemed to be taking a good deal of time to tell
what he had seen, and I tried to hurry him up. He
laughed, then said:</p>

<p>“Well, yesterday afternoon about five o'clock I went
after berries. You don't live here, so I'll tell you
where I went. I went in the fields back of Mr.
Warren's house. Right back of the stone wall that goes
round his place is a big swamp. 'Twas a swamp once,
but it's some filled in now; and across from it are a lot
of berries.”</p>

<p>He paused to pat the Airedale, so I asked:</p>

<p>“Yes, I see what you mean; but what did you see?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. Did not think about it till I heard
those questions in Court, those questions to Jimmy
Weedon about seeing any one on the grounds. Then
I got to thinking about the man I saw.”</p>

<p>As he paused for breath, I told him to go on, and he
continued:</p>

<p>“Just about six—I know it was about six, for the
whistles blew a minute or so afterwards, I saw a man
climb over the wall—that stone wall of Mr. Warren's.
He threw something in the bushes while he was on the
wall.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who the man was?” came my eager
question.</p>

<p>The boy was thoughtful a moment, his face screwed
up in a funny gesture. Then he shook his head
saying:</p>

<p>“No, I don't. He looked like somebody I know; but
I can't tell who he was.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what he threw into the field?”</p>

<p>“Nope. I don't know he threw anything, but I saw
him throw his hand out as if he did throw something
away. I think he had something in it. And then he
went down round the wall, and I did not see him any
more.”</p>

<p>I quickly ran through in my mind what the boy
had said. Though he might have been mistaken in
thinking the man he saw climb over the wall had
thrown something away, yet there was no doubt it was
a valuable piece of information. It seemed to prove
that some one besides the Chinaman had been on
Warren's grounds about the time he must have been killed.
And then I wondered if this could have been the person
in the boat—that person whom no one had seen.</p>

<p>The boy had nothing else to tell. I gave him a dollar
after impressing upon him that he must go at once to
the chief of police and tell him the same story he had
told me. He went away promising to do this, and I sat
back to figure out his story. There was not anything
suspicious, in a sense, in seeing a man climb a stone
wall. But when I remembered that it took place
around the time Warren had been killed, it began to
look important. So far, from all the evidence we had,
there did not seem to be any person who could have
killed him. The secretary had come to the house at
four, and Warren had not been killed until two hours
later. I began to wonder who the man the boy had
seen climbing the wall could have been.</p>

<p>It was still light, though the sun was low. As my
eyes glanced lazily around, they fell upon the open
door of Carter's boat house. The thought came to me,
it might be worth while to take one of the boats and
row along the shore until I reached Warren's land.
There would be time before dark to at least have a
look at the place where the boy said he had seen the
man on the wall.</p>

<p>I went down to the boat house and went within.
There were two row boats lying in the water, and upon
the concrete floor was a red canoe. As the lake was
very calm, I decided the canoe would be the easiest to
manage. I carried it to the water and launched it.
Climbing in rather carefully, I paddled out of the
spillway, and then turned up the lake.</p>

<p>The lake was perfectly calm, without even a ripple
upon its surface. Keeping close to the shore, I
paddled rather slowly, enjoying the sight of the estates
which I passed. All of them had fine lawns which ran
to the water's edge, with little boat houses concealed
among the trees. A little way from shore several
people were fishing, and as I passed a little sandy beach,
I saw some children bathing.</p>

<p>For a short distance the shore ran in a straight line,
then curved around in a half circle to the right. As I
struck across to the point of land which ran out into
the lake, I saw from the stone wall which came down
to the water's edge that I was opposite the Warren
estate. I could see above the trees the library, its red
roof being the highest in sight. But there were no
signs of life, and as I paddled to the shore I saw no one.</p>

<p>At first I had thought I would not land upon the
estate, but that I would beach the canoe at the other
side of the wall. But changing my mind, I landed on
the shore directly in front of the library, which was
some hundred feet away upon the hill. I pulled the
canoe upon the land, half hiding it behind the
low-hanging branches of a willow tree. Then I started across
the grass.</p>

<p>Passing round the front of the library, I saw that
the door was shut and the blinds at the windows. I
did not pause, but went down the other side of the hill,
through a clump of trees, until I reached the rear wall.
The wall was some hundred yards away from the
library, and the boy had said that he had seen the man
in a direct line with the building.</p>

<p>It was a granite wall almost ten feet high. I
wondered a moment how I was going to get over it. A
near-by tree, which had a branch hanging a few feet
over the top of the wall, solved the difficulty. I climbed
the tree, crept out on the branch, and dropped to the
top of the wall. There I sat a moment to get my
bearings.</p>

<p>Behind me stretched the grounds of the murdered
scientist, the many trees hiding all but the top of the
house. Directly back of me was the summer house,
where we had found the body. But to my surprise,
when I turned and looked in the other direction, I found
that in front there was a slight hollow—a mass of
tangled underbrush and small trees. Beyond this
stretched a pasture, losing itself in the woods some
little distance away. The underbrush below me ran
the entire length of the wall, but stopped on my right
where the wall ended. In fact here the ground rose
a few feet to a grass lined meadow.</p>

<p>As I looked at the mass of trees and shrubs, the more
I began to wonder what any one had been doing on the
wall. It was not the way to leave the grounds, for the
person would have been forced to climb the smooth
stones. And then there was nothing but the distant
woods and the field. I wondered if the boy had been
right when he said the man had thrown something
away.</p>

<p>My eyes came again to the slight hollow below me.
It was a tangled mass of shrubbery, with high grass,
only hidden by the small trees which grew to the height
of about eight or nine feet. To try and find anything in
that tangle seemed impossible. But after a moment
I dropped from the wall and started to make my way
through the underbrush.</p>

<p>It was even worse than I had expected. The ground
was soft because of a spring which must have been
near by. Not only were the trees thick, but there was
a tangle of wild rosebushes. Their thorns clung to me
as I tried to push my way through the bushes. Long
before I reached the other side I realized that it was
too late to expect to make any kind of a search. It had
begun to be dusk by the time I reached the wall, and
when I plunged into the underbrush, the thick foliage
made it impossible to see.</p>

<p>Floundering at every step, my clothes pulled and
twisted by the thorns, and with the branches whipping
across my face, I stumbled through the swamp.
Luckily it was not very wet, for if it had been, I would have
been unable to have gotten through. But long before
I reached the more solid ground I swore at myself for
what I was doing. And then, just when I began to
wonder if I would ever reach solid ground, I plunged
out of the thicket into the high grass of the field. With
a sigh of relief I flung myself down on the grass for
breath.</p>

<p>My excursion had been of little value. True, I had
discovered that the boy could have seen some one on
the wall, for I could see its dim shape a few hundred
yards away. I glanced at it a moment, then looked
behind me at the distant woods, and then glanced back
at the wall. And as I looked, to my great surprise I
saw a figure slowly drop from the same branch I had
been on. A dim, indistinct figure, which seemed to be
covered with a long coat—a figure of a man who, as
I looked, dropped lightly on the top of the wall.</p>

<p>It was now dark, but not so dark that I could not
make out the man. The features I could not see, for
he was too far away and the darkness too dense. But
there in front of me, on the other side of the swamp,
was a man—a man who remained but a moment on the
wall and then dropped to the ground. For a second
I lost him from sight, and then I saw the darkness split
by the glare of a flashlight. Like myself, he was
going into the underbrush, throwing the light carefully
before him and going slowly, step by step, as if he was
looking for something.</p>

<p>For a second I wondered what I had better do.
There was no doubt he was searching for something,
and searching very carefully. I could hear the sound
of the underbrush as it broke under his feet. Once
even I heard a muttered exclamation as the man half
fell. The small trees and vines hid him from my sight,
but I could catch the circle of flame from the flashlight
as he swept it to and fro. He was looking for
something, but what? And then it dawned on me that the
boy had been right after all. Something had been
thrown from the wall into the small swamp.</p>

<p>There was little danger of my being seen. Not only
was I in the shadow, but it was also dark. The man
was about a hundred feet away, directly opposite from
where I sat, crouched on the grass. He seemed to be
searching over a rather small circle of ground, and
evidently the search was not very successful. Then
suddenly he threw the light from off the ground at his
feet and directed it through the undergrowth in my
direction. This caused me to move quickly a few feet
to where the grass was higher.</p>

<p>After all there was no necessity of my moving, for
in a moment the flame again swept the ground in a
circle at the man's feet. Wondering what he might
find, and knowing that I could not be seen from where
he was, I rose and walked to the edge of the swamp,
but I could see nothing there. Then, remembering
that the ground rose to a pasture at my left, I
carefully started in that direction. And then, after I had
taken one step, my foot slipped upon a branch, and as
the branch rolled over, I fell into the bushes with a
crash.</p>

<p>I was not hurt, but at the sound of my fall the
flashlight was suddenly extinguished. For a second I lay
still, then, knowing there was no use to keep silent,
arose. And at that second I heard the man blundering
out of the underbrush, and the sound of his running
feet. Instinctively I started to run in the direction
which would the soonest bring me into the open—along
the edge of the swamp, up the little grassy hill, and
then I paused an instant to listen.</p>

<p>For a moment I heard nothing, and then down
below me, in the direction of the lake, I heard the sound
of running feet. Whoever had been on the other side
of the swamp was taking no chance of being seen. As
this thought struck me, I started down the hillside for
the water. The shore was not so far away, but before
I reached it I heard the man half tumble into a boat,
and there came the sound of oars splashing in the
water.</p>

<p>As I reached the shore, almost crashing into the stone
wall of the Warren estate, I heard the faint click of the
oars as the man began to row down the lake. My
canoe was on the other side of the wall. To reach it,
I had to stumble as softly as I could around the wall,
which stopped at the water. Lucky for me, though I
had to wade, the water was not above my shoe tops,
and it took only a moment to reach the canoe. I knew
I had one advantage. It was almost impossible for the
man to row the boat without making some sound with
the oars; but I could paddle the canoe silently.</p>

<p>As I half fell over the canoe, I paused a second,
waiting to catch the faint sound of the oars; then
silently I pushed the canoe into the water, climbed in,
and started to paddle as softly as possible in the
direction of the boat. It was far ahead of me, and the night
was so dark I could see but a few feet in front of me.
But once in a while I could hear the oars click, for the
man was rowing with all his speed, evidently not
knowing that I had a canoe.</p>

<p>It had been my idea that as I could paddle faster
than he could row, I could soon reach him. My plan
was to let him go ashore, and then as he stepped out of
the boat, to reach his side. One thing above all I
wished to do—see who it might be. After that there
were a few questions I wished to ask.</p>

<p>But either I misjudged the distance he was ahead of
me or else he could row far better than I expected. In
my haste I had paddled straight out into the lake,
forgetting for a moment or so that the shore took a wide
curve. When I remembered that, it was to discover
the man had rowed straight across this half circle, and
I had to turn to the shore. This gave him several
extra minutes, and though, when he ran his boat up on the
shore, I was only a few feet away, yet it gave the time
he needed.</p>

<p>He must have discovered just before he beached his
boat that I was behind him. In fact I was so close
that when he rose and jumped to the shore, I could
partly see his figure—an indistinct mass in the
darkness. He half turned, jumped from his boat, partly
stumbled, only to gather himself and run away in the
darkness. The next second my canoe crashed on the
beach, half throwing me to my knees.</p>

<p>Jumping from it, I set out in the direction the man
had taken. We were on some one's lawn, for I saw
the figure darting ahead of me, thrown into reflection
for a moment by the lights of a house. Then it went
through a hedge and was lost to sight. I ran over the
grass, through the opening in the hedge, and then
discovered that I was on Carter's land. As I glimpsed the
running figure ahead, I heard Trouble, who was locked
in the garage, give a sudden bark, and then commence
to bark incessantly. I wished with all my heart the
dog was loose, but there was not time to open the
garage door.</p>

<p>When I ran around the front of Carter's house, the
man was not in sight. In front of me was another
hedge, to my left the lake, and to my right the lawn
ran to the street. In this direction the street lights
made it possible to see that there was no one there.
Deciding the man had gone through the hedge, I ran
down the path, and the next second was on the lawn
which belonged to the minister. But I could see no one,
and though there was a light in the rectory, no running
figure crossed the reflection. The man was gone, but
where?</p>

<p>I stopped running, to walk up the slight incline which
led to the church. Frankly I was puzzled. There had
not been time for him to have gone very far. The
street lights gave enough illumination to at least have
allowed me to have seen if any running figure was
ahead of me. But no one was in sight.</p>

<p>Puzzled, I went rather slowly across the grass and
came to the dark shadow made by the wall of the
church. As I stood silent a moment, I cast my eyes at
the dense mass of the tower, which divided the rectory
from the church proper. It was not a very high tower,
and its top was only a few feet above the roof of the
church. Then I went toward the street, keeping in the
shadow, and when I reached the tower itself, found to
my surprise that the door at the foot was open.</p>

<p>I peered within, only to have my eyes met by the
blackness. Finding a match, I struck it. For the
shortest space of time the darkness was lighted sufficiently
for me to see a very narrow winding pair of stairs
which were lost to sight above my head. Before the
match was out I had time to see an iron railing which
ran along the side of the steps. As darkness came
again, I once more wondered what had happened to the
man. There seemed no chance now of finding him, for
by this time he must have been far away.</p>

<p>And then, for some unknown reason, I decided to
climb the stairs in the tower and see if I could perceive
anything from the roof. Thinking it over later, I saw
how absurd the idea must have been, for the night was
dark and even if I reached the roof, I would not have
been able to see very far. But at the time the only
thing I remembered was that when I had looked at
the tower late in the afternoon I had noticed an iron
railing which ran around its top.</p>

<p>I reached in my pocket for another match, and then
discovered I had just struck the last one. A search of
all my pockets gave no results. Hesitating a moment,
I finally stepped through the open door, groping my
way until my foot plunged against the stone stairs.
Then finding the railing, I began slowly to climb the
steps.</p>

<p>The darkness was intense, and the stairway was not
only very narrow, but it wound around and around in
a bewildering manner. I groped my way from step to
step, my hand firmly grasping the rail. Just about the
time I began to wonder if the steps would never end
I came out in a small room at the top of the tower.
Directly in front of me was an open door, and as my
eyes became more accustomed to the darkness, I saw
that it led to the platform.</p>

<p>When I went through this door, I found myself on
a little balcony, which ran around the top of the tower.
In my first quick glance I saw below me the lights of
the town, and, turning my head, I caught the reflection
of the village streets far away in the distance. I leaned
over the iron railing, saw the dark shadow of the roof
a few feet below me, and began to wonder why under
heaven I had ever climbed the steps.</p>

<p>After walking completely around the balcony, I came
back to my place near the open door. Though I had
peered over the edge on all sides, I had seen nothing.
Only the lights of the town, the street lamps and the
reflections from the houses had broken the blackness.
I had just about made up my mind to descend when
a sudden sound behind me caused me to stiffen to
attention. It was only a slight sound, and what it was
I could not tell. But as I started to turn, suddenly
from behind I felt something move, and the next
moment two hands suddenly gripped my body.</p>

<p>The attack was so sudden and unexpected that, taken
off my guard as I was, I did not move until the man
had secured my arms with a firm grip. I tried to throw
them aside, but I might just as well have tried to break
a steel rope. Whoever it was had terrific strength,
for they held me in such a position that I was unable
to move. Throwing my body to this side and that, I
tried to break the grip, but it was impossible. And
silently, save only for the man's quick breathing, I was
being borne to the iron rail.</p>

<p>The man had seized me from the rear, and as I was
unable to turn I could not see him. Even if I had been
able to turn, I could not have distinguished him, for
the night was too dark. Silently, without a word, he
pushed me against the rail. Then as its iron began
to cut into my back, he tried to lift me from the
platform. In horror it came over me that he was trying
to throw me from the tower.</p>

<p>With a sudden burst of strength I managed to free
myself from one of the clutching hands and half
turned. But the effort was in vain. Again the arms
closed around me, and as I slipped on the stone floor,
I felt myself being raised and the iron rail pressing
against my back. I tried to regain my feet—tried to
throw off the clutching hands, but could not; and then,
as if my weight was of no avail, the man lifted me
slowly but surely until my feet were off the floor. Then
he gave a sudden push, and with a cry I went off the
platform.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch07">

<h2>Chapter VII. <br> The Chief and I—Make a Call</h2>

<p>It is said that a person drowning has all the events
of his life pass before him. I do not know if that is
true or not; but in the brief second in which I was
falling through space I had but one thought—how foolish
I had been to have ever climbed those tower stairs.
The thought must have come and gone in a mere flash
of time, but it seemed long enough for me to reflect
over. Then, with a crash and a jar which seemed to
shake every bone in my body, I struck the roof.
Struck the roof and started to roll down its side.</p>

<p>Luckily, there was not a very steep pitch to the roof,
and I managed to stop my slide just as I reached the
eaves. Aching in every part of my body, I pulled
myself into a sitting position and gave a cautious look
around. Above me was the tower, and I thanked my
stars that the height was only about six feet. If I had
fallen several feet from where I did, I would not have
stopped until I reached the ground. And there is no
doubt I would have been killed. As it was, it seemed
a miracle that I had not broken any bones. For though
I was pretty sore from the fall, I decided there was
nothing else the matter.</p>

<p>But my position was far from enviable. I was sitting
on the very edge of the roof between the church and
the rectory, about thirty feet from the ground. The
pitch of the roof was not so steep but what I could
climb it, but that would do me no particular good.
Above me was the roof of the house, and I
remembered that I had seen a light in the rectory as I
came across the lawn. There must be some sort of an
arrangement to reach the roof through the rectory attic.
I decided to try and find it.</p>

<p>Carefully I edged myself along and began to climb
over the smooth expanse of the rectory shingles.
Though they were slippery, yet the pitch was the same
as that of the church, and I had no difficulty.
Halfway up the roof I found what I had expected—an
opening into the attic. But when I had seated myself
on the wooden hatch, I was no better off than before.
It was locked, and I was unable to open it.</p>

<p>Sitting there for a few moments, I tried to puzzle out
what I should do next. I did not intend to spend the
night on the roof if I could help it, and yet there did
not seem to be any way down to the ground. Then I
began to bang on the covered opening—banging with
my feet, pounding and pounding. I would do this for a
moment, then wait, only to bang again. Just as I was
about ready to give up hope I heard footsteps in
the attic, and a very surprised voice cried in a muffled
tone:</p>

<p>“What's that?”</p>

<p>I yelled out that I was on the roof and climbed off
the cover of the trap door. In a moment it was slowly
lifted, and, looking through the opening, I saw the
rather startled face of the minister. I drew myself to
the edge and dropped at his surprised feet on the attic
floor. As I straightened up, I saw his eyes sweep over
me, and they grew very wide as he gasped:</p>

<p>“Good heavens! it's Mr. Pelt.”</p>

<p>I must have been a rather sorry-looking object. The
branches of the trees through which I had pushed my
way while in the swamp had torn my clothes. One
leg of my trousers flapped to and fro as I moved. I
was covered with dirt, while my shoes were a mass of
mud. My face, which his eyes gazed upon in
amazement, must have been a sight, for after one look he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What has happened to you, Mr. Pelt? And—and,
why were you on my roof?”</p>

<p>I started to explain, when, remembering his duties,
he begged me to come down in his library. I followed
him down the attic steps to the first floor, where we went
into a room lined with books. He motioned to a chair,
excused himself and left the room. In a moment he
returned, bringing with him a bottle and a glass. As
he poured out the wine, he said he thought I needed
it, and then, dropping into a chair, watched me while
I drank.</p>

<p>His eyes were very curious, yet he was too well bred
to ask me what had happened. Placing the glass on
the near-by table, I told him briefly of what had taken
place. My visit to the swamp I passed over lightly,
but did tell of seeing a man run through Carter's hedge,
and how I had followed him. As I told of the sudden
attack upon the roof of his tower, and how I was
thrown over the side, he gave a gesture of horror.</p>

<p>“Heavens, man!” he said, “some one tried to kill
you.”</p>

<p>I agreed to this, and there fell a silence. He broke
it to say that there was nothing unusual in the door
of the tower being open. In fact it was never locked,
the village people using it for a place from which to
give their visitors a view of the lake. But to hear that
which had happened to me should have taken place
upon his property shocked him. His dark eyes never
left my face as he expressed again and again his horror.
I could see that from his point of view the whole thing
was unexplainable.</p>

<p>He told me he had been reading, and he pointed out
where he had thrown his book when he heard the
sound of my pounding on the roof. He half laughed
as he said that for a moment he was a very astonished
man. He could hear some kind of a banging overhead,
and at last went up the steps to the attic. There he
was startled to discover that the sound came from the
roof. When he heard my voice, he thought for a
moment the boys of the village were playing some sort of
a prank.</p>

<p>The clock suddenly striking eleven roused me to the
lateness of the hour. With a little exclamation of pain
at the stiffness of my muscles I rose to my feet saying
that I had better be going. He went with me to the
door, then out upon the lawn. There we both turned
and looked at the tower, which loomed above our heads.
Saying “good night,” I went rather slowly across the
grass, through the opening in the hedge, and over
Carter's lawn.</p>

<p>The large living room was a blaze of light, and I
went up the steps and into the house. Carter and
Ranville were sitting in two large chairs talking very
earnestly. It was the Englishman who saw me first, and I
half laughed as I saw his eyes sweep over my
disheveled figure and his jaw drop. Catching Ranville's
expression, Carter turned to see what he was looking
at. Giving me one amazed look, he rose to his feet
and came over in my direction.</p>

<p>“In the name of God, Pelt, what have you been
doing?” was his shocked question.</p>

<p>I dropped into a chair and told him a drink of
Scotch would be very agreeable. With one look at my
face he hurried out of the room. In a second he
returned with a bottle and, placing it on a stand, took
three glasses from his pocket. Ranville's eyes wore a
questioning look, but he made no inquiries until I had
finished my drink. Even then it was Carter who broke
out:</p>

<p>“What happened, Pelt.”</p>

<p>Going into a long account of my experiences, I told
them of the visit of the boy and my trip to the swamp.
They said nothing until I spoke of the attack which
had been made on me in the tower, and how the man
had tried to throw me off the top. Here Ranville
broke in to say dryly that from my looks he judged
the man had succeeded. I nodded, and then told how
I had struck the roof, and that the minister had let me
into his house through the opening in his attic.</p>

<p>When I had finished, Carter was silent a moment,
then jumped to his feet and left the room. Ranville
poured me out another drink, took a small one for
himself and said:</p>

<p>“You struck something to-night, Pelt, but what it
was I would give a good deal to know.”</p>

<p>Shaking my head, I sank back in the chair. All
at once I realized how tired I was, and that I was
terribly sore. Every bone in my body seemed to be aching,
and each time I moved I found a new sore spot. My
eyes fell on my suit—stained by the grass and smeared
with dirt. But for the time being I was too tired to
go to my room and change.</p>

<p>When Carter returned, he came to my side and said:</p>

<p>“I just got hold of the chief, Pelt. It struck me that
if there is anything in the swamp, the chief better see
that no one gets it before the police do. I told him
what the boy said to you—how he saw some one throw
something away. He says that he has not been to the
station to-night, and so does not know if the boy went
down, as you told him to.”</p>

<p>He paused and went on. “I told him just a wee bit
about what you saw, suggesting he have a couple of
men by the swamp to-night in case the man goes back.
He is going to do that.”</p>

<p>He gave me another look, and at my expression half
laughed. Then he said:</p>

<p>“What you need, Pelt, is a warm bath and a good
night's rest. You are pretty lucky not to have been
killed; and after this we'd better not let you go around
alone.”</p>

<p>His suggestion of a bath was a good one, and they
followed me to my room and bade me good night.
After I had turned on the water in the tub I glanced
at myself in the wall mirror. I was a sorry object, and
when I saw my face, I could not blame Carter for
smiling. There was a great streak of dirt across my
cheek, and a large bruise over one eye; my hair was a
tangled mass. When I turned away from the glass, I
remembered my hat was still on the roof of the church.</p>

<p>I looked myself over pretty well after I undressed
and decided that, save for several bruises, I was
unharmed, True, I was very sore, but the warm water
would aid that. After staying in the water for a long
while, I rubbed myself well with alcohol, and crept
between the sheets of the bed. I gave a sigh of
contentment as my tired body felt the cool linen. For a while
I tried to puzzle out all that had taken place—tried,
only to give it up as sleep crept down upon me. Then
with a sigh I turned over and knew no more.</p>

<p>It was long after ten when I went down to the
dining room the next morning. As I took my place at the
breakfast table, the housekeeper handed me a note
saying that Carter had left it. It simply announced
that both he and Ranville had gone to Warren's funeral,
and they thought they would let me sleep. Breakfast
over, I strolled out on the lawn and for a while amused
myself by playing ball with the dog. Tiring of this
after a while, I went up on the veranda to read a
magazine.</p>

<p>I had been reading perhaps about ten minutes when
I was hailed by a voice from the walk and, glancing
down, I saw the heavy, thick-set figure of the chief of
police. He came up the steps and dropped into a
near-by chair, wiping his face with his handkerchief as if he
was warm. Under one arm he had a small package
which he was handling very carefully. For a while we
talked in a general way, until I began to wonder what
it might be that had caused him to come to the house.</p>

<p>At length, after taking a pipe from his pocket and
which he took some time in filling, he said:</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Pelt, I understand that you are with one
of the best detectives in the country.”</p>

<p>I agreed to this, and he went on:</p>

<p>“I have something here might interest you.”</p>

<p>He took the package from under his arm and slowly
but very carefully unwrapped it. There seemed to be
far more paper used in wrapping than was necessary,
but at length he reached the object he was after.
Giving it one rather strange look, he handed it to me
without a word. It was a dagger of a style and
workmanship which I had never seen before. The blade was very
long and extremely thin, and it came to a decidedly
sharp point—a point which not only was sharp, but
also very clean; the steel of which it was made was
glazed a dark green, and the handle had several figures
carved upon it.</p>

<p>After I had looked it over I gave him a questioning
glance. His response was quick:</p>

<p>“After Mr. Carter called me last night I sent two
men round to Warren's. Had them watch that swamp
all night. They saw no one. This morning I got a lot
of boys and set them to work. They went all over the
place—that's what they found,” and he waved one hand
at the dagger.</p>

<p>I cast another glance at the dagger, wondering if it
could have been the thing the boy said he saw the man
on the wall throwing away. As if reading my thoughts,
the chief said:</p>

<p>“The doc saw this awhile ago. He thinks it's the
knife that did the killing.”</p>

<p>Realizing that the chief did not know all of my
adventure of the night before, I told him of what had
taken place. He seemed very startled, but then I knew
that the murder itself had been a bit more than he was
accustomed to. He listened, however, without a word,
though he did slowly shake his head when I told of
seeing the man who was searching in the swamp. But
when I mentioned of being thrown from the tower of
the church, he gave a sudden start. As I ended, he
said quickly:</p>

<p>“You know, Mr. Pelt, this murder, of course, upsets
me. We don't have many crimes that amount to
anything here. My work is mostly small stuff. But this
murder sort of gets me. To start with, Warren was the
biggest man in this place. I can't for the life of me
think of any reason why any one should bump him
off.”</p>

<p>I made no reply to this, studying the man before
me. There was something likable about the
chief—something about the humorous smile he had that
caused me to warm to him. But his face was puzzled,
and it was clear to see he was, as he put it, upset. I
could readily understand that the murder of the most
important man in his town would cause him to realize
the responsibilities resting upon his shoulders. Our
eyes suddenly met and, throwing out his hands in a
gesture of appeal, he said: “You know, Mr. Pelt, this
murder is a little too deep for me. I wish you could see
your way clear to help me a bit.”</p>

<p>I assured him I would be glad to do anything within
my power, but warned him that most of the work upon
criminal cases which I had been in had been done by
Bartley. He listened with a serious air, and when I
finished remarked:</p>

<p>“That's all right; but you can help me, I know.
Now I have been thinking. You heard what Warren's
housekeeper said yesterday about that girl. How she
said he ought to be killed.”</p>

<p>He paused as if refreshing his memory, then burst
forth:</p>

<p>“That's a hell of a thing for a nice girl to say. But
the thing I have got to do now is to find her. I had
two of the cops out, but they can't find any one who
has even seen her. Now I was thinking, perhaps you
would go with me to see her aunt. She ought to know
something about the girl. One of the boys asked the
aunt last night if she knew where she was, and she said,
‘No.’ But she might give us some idea. What do you
say?”</p>

<p>There was an appealing look on his face as he
glanced at me, and I was willing to agree that the aunt
should be questioned. Upon asking him when he
wanted to go, he said: “At once,” and I told him that
if he would wait until I found my hat, I would go with
him. The hat found, we went down the steps, and he
started for the road, saying that his Ford was standing
there. I told him I thought we might go in more
comfort in my car and, going to the garage, drove it out to
the road. The Airedale jumped into the seat as I
stopped for the chief, and as there was plenty of room,
I let him stay.</p>

<p>It took us at least fifteen minutes to reach the house
before which we stopped. It was a small white place
set far back from the street, with a white fence before
it. The path we went up was lined with flowers, and
roses climbed over the doorway of the house. It was
a very pleasant old lady who answered our ringing of
the bell—an old lady whose smile turned into an
anxious look as she perceived the chief.</p>

<p>She led us into an old-fashioned parlor of the sort
I had not seen for years. The haircloth furniture was
of a beautiful design, and the old prints upon the wall
took me back to my boyhood days in New England.
Motioning us to a chair, she seated herself, with a very
anxious look upon her face. Then, without waiting
for the chief to tell his errand, she asked in a trembling
voice:</p>

<p>“I hope you have not heard anything bad about
Florence?”</p>

<p>The chief shook his head. “No, Mrs. West,” he
replied. “I don't know anything bad about her. But I
wanted to ask you some questions. You see we don't
know where Florence is, and so far I can't find any one
who does. Now, did she come to your house yesterday
afternoon?”</p>

<p>The woman was rocking back and forth in her chair.
When she answered, I could tell she was worried.</p>

<p>“No,” came the reply. “I have not seen her for
several days. You know when she got that position with
Mr. Warren, she had to stay at his house. She said
he often had her work at night, and it was too far to
come back here. She did run in every day or so, but
I have not seen her for at least three days. And
then—” she paused as if shocked by what she was
going to add, then said: “And then I heard about her
saying that Mr. Warren ought to be killed.”</p>

<p>The face of the old lady was flushed, but the
expression was more one of perplexity than anything else.
Her eyes did not leave the chief's face.</p>

<p>“You know, of course, that, though Florence was a
very impulsive girl, she was a good girl,” she added
proudly.</p>

<p>The chief nodded, and the aunt continued:</p>

<p>“Now I thought Florence just said that—that about
Mr. Warren being killed, because she was mad over
something. She would not have meant it, would she?”</p>

<p>Her eyes met the chief's imploringly. He shifted his
heavy weight and then with a sheepish expression
remarked: “No—but then, Mrs. West, why did she take
her suit case and say she was not coming back? Where
did she go? That's what I want to know.”</p>

<p>To this the woman could give no reply. There was
no doubt she was very much puzzled over what had
happened to her niece. But at the same time she was
sure the girl was all right. As to any place that she
might have gone, she did not know. She added that
her niece was a girl who did not go out, as she put it,
very much, and that she had no idea where she might
be.</p>

<p>We were just on the verge of leaving when I asked
her if she knew of any young man she went around
with. Her reply was that Florence did not care much
for young men; but in a moment she mentioned a
Robert Hunt with whom she once in a while went to
dances. At the name I shot a glance at the chief to
see if he knew the man.</p>

<p>He nodded. “I know him. That's the young man
who is studying law in Judge Thompson's law office.
A fine young fellow.”</p>

<p>The aunt informed us that occasionally the young
man came to the house to see Florence and took her to
dances. But he seemed to be the only young man
with whom the girl had anything to do, for the old lady
could not think of any other person the girl had been
interested in, and with this we left.</p>

<p>I dropped the chief in front of Carter's. Leaving the
car in the drive, I went into the house to be greeted by
the two men with the news that lunch was ready. As
we went into the dining room, they asked me how I felt
after my night's escapade, and grinned a little when I
told them I was a little sore. Then as we seated
ourselves at the table, I told them of the visit of the chief
and of the finding of the dagger. They made hardly
any comment, though Ranville said he wanted to have
a look at the weapon.</p>

<p>During the lunch they told me about the funeral.
Not only had it been largely attended, but there had
never been so many famous men in the village before.
From the various colleges there had come the
scientists to pay their last respects to the famous man who
had worked with them. And then, after mentioning
the names of some who had been at the funeral—names
known the world over in intellectual circles—Ranville
said:</p>

<p>“You know, Pelt, we wondered what would be done
with the notes of Warren's trip, and how the world had
been waiting for his account of his discoveries. We
mentioned that the book must be finished. Well, we
heard this morning that Niles Patton, who was with
him on the trip, will finish the book.”</p>

<p>I turned to Carter, asking him if he knew Patton,
only to be told that he knew him very well. He was a
young assistant professor at Harvard, working under
Warren in anthropology, and had been with him in
China. And then Carter said that Patton would take
up his task at once, and would be at work in the Warren
library to-morrow.</p>

<p>Lunch was almost over, and we were just drinking
our coffee when there came the sound of the door bell
and the loud barking of the dog upon the lawn. The
housekeeper passed through the room to the door, and
in a moment returned. As she stood by Carter's side,
he asked:</p>

<p>“Who is it, Mrs. Hart?”</p>

<p>She shook her head saying: “I don't know, Mr.
Carter. The man says he must see you. I never saw
him before.” She paused a second, then finished:
“It's a Chinaman.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch08">

<h2>Chapter VIII. <br> We Have a Visitor—and—I Take a Ride</h2>

<p>For a moment no one spoke. As our eyes met, the
look we gave each other was a wondering one. I saw
a half smile play around Ranville's lips, and then Carter
rose and started for the living room, we after him. The
same thought must have been in the minds of each of
us. Was this man at the door the Chinaman Warren's
housekeeper had said came to the door around the
time he was killed?</p>

<p>The housekeeper had gone to the front door again,
and by the time we reached the living room was
ushering the man into our presence. He was the tallest man
of his race I have seen, with a well-developed body
and a very lean face. He was wearing a white silk
suit, and as he came across the room to our side, bore
himself with easy grace. His cold black eyes swept
over the three of us, and then in the most perfect
English and in a very cultured voice he asked:</p>

<p>“And which is Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>Carter replied, and the man half smiled—a smile
which lit up his yellow face. Then he said:</p>

<p>“No doubt you do not know me, Mr. Carter, but you
have been pointed out to me in Washington. My name
is Lee Kong, and I have at times been connected with
our London Embassy.”</p>

<p>The English was perfect, and there was no doubt he
was one of those well-educated Chinamen which one
meets so often in the various capitals of the world. His
general air was that of breeding and of culture, and
one could feel back of it all the many thousand
years of racial blood. Carter introduced us and
motioned to a chair. After seating himself the man
said:</p>

<p>“I saw your name in the paper, Mr. Carter. And I
thought that perhaps you might be the best man to
whom to tell my story.”</p>

<p>Carter took his cigar case and offered it to him, but
he begged to be excused. Taking a gold case from his
pocket, he lighted a long, straw-colored cigarette and
leaned back in his chair. His shrewd eyes took us all
in, and then with a little laugh he leaned forward to
say:</p>

<p>“Perhaps I had better tell you just who I am. I have
been connected with both our London and Washington
Embassies. I knew Dr. Warren very well. It is in
regard to my visit to his house yesterday that I wish
to speak. You know, of course, I was there.”</p>

<p>I was rather surprised at the cool manner in which
the oriental admitted he was the man the housekeeper
had seen. Carter replied he knew some one of his race
had been there, but that was all. Over the yellow face
came a half smile, and then the words:</p>

<p>“Yes, I was the man. I knew inquiries would be
made, and thought I had better tell my story to some
one who could understand. I have been staying at
Cooperstown. When I read in the papers about the
inquest, I saw your name, and I decided you were the
person to see.”</p>

<p>There was an air of sureness about the man which
was annoying. That the police were very keen to question
him did not seem to enter his head, or if it did, he
was not interested. I believed he was the last and,
for that matter, the only person who had seen Warren
around the time of his death. As I looked at the
impassive, yellow face, with the cold, black eyes, I
wondered if he held the solution of the mystery. As if
reading my thoughts, his suave glance met mine, and
he said:</p>

<p>“I can assure you I did not kill Mr. Warren. He
was dead when I went into his library.”</p>

<p>We gave a start, but the face of the man did not
change a particle. Coolly, he repeated the statement:
“He was dead when I saw him.”</p>

<p>Slowly lighting another of his thin yellow cigarettes,
he carefully inhaled the smoke, then added:</p>

<p>“Mr. Warren, as you know, spent two years in the
heart of my country. In fact, I aided him in some of
his arrangements before he started. China, like all
other nations, has citizens who are not law-abiding.
You may remember that when Mr. Warren did not
return at the expected time, it was said he had been killed
by outlaws. That, of course, was but a rumor. He
returned safely, but his leaving China made some little
comment among our people.”</p>

<p>He paused, then continued: “You perhaps know the
story of Buddha's death—how his body was burnt, the
ashes placed in seven boxes and buried in seven places.”</p>

<p>As I looked at him, I wondered what he was driving
at, but he went on:</p>

<p>“Of course, many of the Christian missionaries have
said that the story was a myth.” A little smile passed
over his lips and, shrugging his shoulders, he continued:</p>

<p>“Just what the missionaries tell their converts now
I cannot say; but only a few years ago there was
discovered not only one of the shrines of Buddha in India,
but they found one of the boxes with his ashes. That
is now a matter of history.”</p>

<p>He glanced at our interested faces, and then said
half apologetically:</p>

<p>“You, perhaps, wonder what this has to do with
Warren. I will tell you. Buddhism is not the religion
of China, though there are a good many Buddhists.
But tradition has said that in one of our temples far
out in the desert, there was a shrine which contained
the ashes of the great teacher. Three years ago
outlaws ravaged the temple, and among their spoils was
the box which our tradition said contained the ashes
of the Blessed One.”</p>

<p>He paused to light another cigarette, and then came
his smooth voice:</p>

<p>“To get at the heart of the matter, that box in some
manner fell into Warren's hands. I had been in
correspondence with him for several months asking him to
return it to me. It was of no value to him, and it did
mean a good deal to some of my countrymen. He was
willing to give it up, and it was for that purpose I came
to his house two days ago.”</p>

<p>“And you found him dead?” came Carter's question.</p>

<p>The dark head bowed, repeating slowly: “I found
him dead.”</p>

<p>He threw out his hands in a gesture of
resignation.</p>

<p>“His soul had joined his ancestors.” He paused,
then went on rather quickly:</p>

<p>“I went up the path as the servant directed me. The
library door was open, and after knocking several
times I took the liberty of entering. Mr. Warren was
lying back of his desk upon the floor; there was a knife
protruding from his chest.”</p>

<p>“You say that the knife was in his body?” came
Carter's startled voice.</p>

<p>As if surprised at his tone, the Chinaman studied
him coolly. “Yes. You seem surprised.”</p>

<p>Carter made no reply to the question, but asked him
if he had seen any one, and if he closed the door after
he left. To both he answered: “No”; then seeing our
amazed faces, he added:</p>

<p>“You perhaps wonder why I did not report his death
to the police.”</p>

<p>He was silent a moment, studying the gloss of his
nails; then, raising his head, he said:</p>

<p>“That, of course, was not my affair. Then again I
failed to see why I should become—what is it you
say—mixed up in a violent death. I had nothing to do
with it, and it was not my affair in the least.”</p>

<p>He paused and there fell a silence—a silence broken
by Ranville speaking for the first time:</p>

<p>“You wrote to Mr. Warren, you say—telling him you
were to visit him?”</p>

<p>The yellow figure in the chair slightly inclined his
head in assent. Then Ranville asked:</p>

<p>“Did you type your letter?”</p>

<p>The voice was cold as the oriental replied:</p>

<p>“As it was a personal letter, naturally I did him the
courtesy of writing it with my own hand.”</p>

<p>Again silence, in which I wondered what might be
in the brain of the inscrutable figure in the chair. His
eyes went over the three of us, and I thought I saw a
little show of contempt in the glance. It was Carter
who broke the silence—a silence which was becoming
awkward.</p>

<p>“Did you find the box?”</p>

<p>The man rose, and once more I thought that he was
the tallest man of his race I had ever seen. As he
bent to take his hat in his hand, I noticed how long
his fingers were and how flexible they appeared. Then
as he straightened up, he answered the question:</p>

<p>“No, I did not find it. If I had, I would have taken
it with me. I left everything as it was and departed.
The door was still open when I went away.”</p>

<p>He turned as if he thought the interview was over.
Behind the man's back Ranville's eyes met Carter's,
and there was a little amused look in them. He
reached the door before Carter spoke:</p>

<p>“Will you go with me and tell your story to the chief
of police?”</p>

<p>The man turned quickly. There seemed to be a
surprised tone in his voice as he replied:</p>

<p>“The police? Why, no, why should I bother with
them. You can tell them what I have said.”</p>

<p>He smiled and added sarcastically: “They can find
me. I am in Cooperstown—at the Inn.” Then bowing
very low, he begged us not to go to the door, and went
out into the air.</p>

<p>For a moment after his steps died away no one
spoke. The man had gone as quietly as he had
arrived. His story, to say the least, was odd. Then, with
a decided shake of his head, Carter burst forth:</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that yarn? For my
part I don't believe it.”</p>

<p>“It is pretty hard to say, Carter,” Ranville laughed
in reply. “I have had a good deal of experience with
the Chinese, and it has been my idea that it is almost
impossible to say what goes on back of their
almond-shaped eyes. Yet he may have told the truth, at
that.”</p>

<p>“I don't believe it,” was Carter's energetic protest.
“That Chinaman was about as smooth an article as I
have ever seen. It's my idea he knew it was only a
question of a day or so before he would have been
traced. That's why he came around and told that
yarn. There is no way of saying it is not so; his word
is as good as ours.”</p>

<p>He brought his fist down on the arm of his chair,
then added: “But there is one thing I can do. I will
wire my chief in Washington and get all the
information there is about him. If he has been around the
Embassy, the chief will have the dope on him.”</p>

<p>“His story of Warren being dead, with the knife still
in the body and the door open, makes the affair look
a bit different than what we found,” I commented.</p>

<p>Ranville carefully lighted a cigar, watched the first
smoke ring circle above his head, and then said:</p>

<p>“If we presume that his story is true, it opens up
several interesting theories. Who took the knife from
the body? Who closed the door?” and he paused.</p>

<p>“And who killed him?” broke in Carter's disgusted
voice.</p>

<p>Rising to his feet, he stood before our chairs, his
hands in his pocket, and said earnestly:</p>

<p>“There's that story of his about the box with the
ashes of Buddha in it. There were a number of boxes
in the room. Who knows if he did not take it? For
that matter, who can tell if anything was taken from
Warren's library? We won't get very far as to
discovering why Warren was killed until we find a motive
of some sort. At present there is no one who can tell
us if anything was taken from the library. No one
knows anything about its contents anyway.”</p>

<p>“Only the secretary,” was Ranville's dry comment,
“and no one knows where she is.”</p>

<p>As they both looked at me, I told them of my visit
to the girl's aunt, and of what the woman had said.
They listened until I was through, and then said that
the most important thing the chief had to do was to
find the secretary. Not only would she have to explain
her statement, that Warren ought to be killed, but there
was something else she could do. As she had worked
with Mr. Warren, she must be familiar with the
contents of his library. She alone could tell us if anything
was missing. Until we knew that fact there was little
we could go on.</p>

<p>We discussed this for a while, and in the midst of
our talk the telephone rang. Carter went out into the
hall to answer it. He returned in a moment to tell me
I was wanted on the phone. Taking the receiver, I
found the chief of police on the other end of the wire.
He had received—as he put it—a good tip as to where
the missing secretary was. He mentioned that it was
about twenty miles away, over the mountains, and
asked if I would be willing to take my car and go with
him. I told him I would be at the station in a few
moments and rang off.</p>

<p>Returning to the living room, I told them what the
chief had said, and Carter tried to figure out where we
might be going. He said there were any number of
small lakes in the near-by mountains which were as
inaccessible as though they were hundreds of miles
away. Some of these lakes were camping spots, and
many of them did not have even a telephone. He
followed me out to the car to remind me that it might
not be a bad idea for me to take my chains along.
Then as he wished me good-by, I drove out of the yard.</p>

<p>The police station was a small squatty brick
building, set directly back of a white church. I stopped at
the curb and, climbing down, went through the open
door into the large room within. Behind a desk, with
his feet higher than his head, was a policeman reading
a newspaper. He dropped the paper long enough to ask
me what I wanted. At my request for the chief, he
motioned to a door at the left and then went back to
his reading. Walking across the floor, I pushed open
the door and passed into the next room.</p>

<p>Evidently it was the private office of the chief. A
small room with two chairs and a desk for furniture.
Upon the walls were several gaudy calendars and two
or three placards announcing a reward for various
wanted men. At the desk, busily engaged in looking
over a large scale map, was the chief. He motioned to
the other chair, and as I pulled it up to the desk, he
started to thank me for my willingness to go with him.</p>

<p>As my eyes dropped to the map, he saw my glance
and, pushing back his chair, said:</p>

<p>“Well, I think maybe I have got hold of a good tip
about that girl. I got hold of the young law student
she goes around with. He said that he saw her about
half-past four the afternoon of the murder.”</p>

<p>“He did!” was my comment.</p>

<p>“Yep, he did,” was the retort. “And he saw her
again at five. She was climbing into the old Ford which
belongs to the camp at Lake Pleasant. That's a small
girls' camp over Bald Mountain. It's twenty-five miles
from here, and about as bad a road as you can find.
Once a week the Ford comes into town for provisions
and the mail.”</p>

<p>A twenty-five-mile ride over a bad road did not
appear very pleasing. I asked the chief why he did not
telephone and see if the girl was there.</p>

<p>“For the simple reason there is no telephone in
camp. The nearest one is over five miles away, on the
side of another hill. Besides I had an idea it might be
best to see the girl ourselves. The young man said she
was in the Ford when it went out of town. And if she
was, then she must be at the camp.”</p>

<p>I agreed it might be best to see the girl ourselves,
and in a short time we went out to the car. I stopped
at a filling station to make sure the tank was full and
that I had enough oil. Then we headed for the hills,
which were but a few miles away. For a while we
drove on a fine state highway, with summer estates
and small farms for company. But after we had gone
a few miles we turned off the main road to follow a
narrow, dirt highway—a road which grew narrower as
we went along—with a brook by the side, which was
running swiftly down to the lake.</p>

<p>Not only was the road narrow, but it was in horrible
condition. Deep ruts ran along its sides and across its
surface. The scenery became more desolate, and the
farms fewer. In a short while the pasture land
vanished, and on each side of us were deep woods. The
road began to climb, growing steeper with every foot,
and soon I was forced to put the car into second gear.
Though it was a very well-built machine, yet we
bounded from side to side upon the seat. Once as we
struck an extra deep rut, I heard the chief mutter an
oath as he came down against the side of the car.</p>

<p>We reached the top of the mountain at last, and
found that there was a clear space ahead of us. We
could look far down into the valley below and across
to another range of hills. A wild country useless for
farming, and without a house in sight. But as I swept
around a bend in the road, I saw far below me the
shining waters of several small lakes. One of these
the chief pointed out as being our destination.</p>

<p>If anything, the descent of the hill was even worse
than coming up. I could well see why those who
camped in the valley did not make many trips to town.
The road became so narrow that there was not room
for two cars to pass, and I wondered at times if I could
keep on it. Not only that, but it suddenly started to
sweep around abrupt heights, in sharp, sudden
curves—curves which took all one's skill to make. It was
with a little sigh of relief that I came off the
mountain and began to follow the road which ran through
two rows of trees.</p>

<p>Suddenly we came out of the wood, to find ourselves
by the shore of a small lake—a lake which formed
almost a complete glimmering circle, with trees coming
down to the water's edge. The road followed the shore
of the lake for a few hundred yards, then took an
abrupt bend, to again come back to the water. And
then, as we came around the bend, I saw three small
buildings ahead of us—buildings placed in a cleared
spot of ground, and with a little wharf in front which
ran into the lake. And it was here we stopped.</p>

<p>The buildings were the sort of summer cottages that
one finds so often, built more for cheapness than for
looks or even comfort. But when we climbed out of
the car and went across the high grass, we found that
there was no one at home. The cottages were occupied,
for the doors were not locked. Hammocks were swung
under the trees, and on the verandas were chairs with
magazines flung upon them. But there was no one at
home; and when we went down to the wharf, we found
the boats were not in. Evidently we would have to
wait until they returned.</p>

<p>We seated ourselves upon the edge of the wharf
and let our legs dangle over the water. Lighting my
cigar as the chief lighted his pipe, I gazed at the scene
before. On all sides the woods circled the lake, the
trees green and restful to the eyes. Above in a blue
sky little fleecy clouds floated by, only to be reflected
in the darker blue of the lake. And on every side were
the hills, with the lake below, like the bottom to a cup.</p>

<p>For a while we sat there, and the chief told me the
camp was run by one of the churches in the village.
But after a time conversation ceased, and we sat and
smoked, dreaming in the sunlight. Once in a while a
fish would jump from the water—a gleaming mass of
silver—and fall back with a splash; then would come
the scream of a bird far down the lake. But save for
these, the air was very still. And just as I was
beginning to grow sleepy, the chief cried, pointing down
the lake:</p>

<p>“I guess they are coming.”</p>

<p>I gazed in the direction he pointed and saw three
small boats far down the lake. They were moving
very slowly, but once in a while I could catch the echo
of laughter. We watched them approach nearer, until
the people in the boats could be seen—a number of
girls in bathing suits, girls laughing and talking.</p>

<p>They had almost reached the dock before they saw
us and for a moment their voices suddenly ceased.
Then, recognizing the chief, they waved their hands at
him. In a moment the row boats were by the dock,
and I started to offer to aid them with their ropes; but
instead of tying to the dock they ran their boats upon
the shore and soon ten girls in bathing suits came
running down the planks of the wharf. I could tell they
were curious and that the presence of the chief puzzled
them.</p>

<p>From out of the ten figures there stepped a girl who
evidently had been in the water only a few moments
before. Her one-piece suit clung to the perfect figure,
and I noticed that her shapely legs were whiter than
the other girls, as though she had not been in the sun
very long. Her face was keen, and her laughing eyes
turned upon the chief. She advanced almost in front
of him and in a laughing voice said:</p>

<p>“Did you come after me, chief?”</p>

<p>The chief rose slowly to his feet and his face was
serious as he turned and faced the girl. As their eyes
met something about his expression drove the laughter
from her face and her cheeks flushed. For a moment
they stood there, their eyes meeting, and then the chief
said very simply:</p>

<p>“I am afraid I did, Miss Harlan.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch09">

<h2>Chapter IX. <br> In Which Bartley Arrives</h2>

<p>The girl's question had been asked in a laughing
voice and her eyes had danced as she spoke to the chief.
But the rather curt reply of the police officer and the
tone of seriousness in his voice caused the smile to
slowly fade from her face. For a moment she looked
at him, and then in a trembling voice asked:</p>

<p>“Why—what is the matter?”</p>

<p>The other girls had crowded around. Their eyes
were bright with wonder, curious to know what was
the trouble. The chief gave them an uncertain look,
then said that there was not much the matter, but he
wished to speak to the secretary alone. Reluctantly
they started toward the cottages, casting back many
wondering glances. As they reached the piazza of the
central cottage they broke into excited conversation.</p>

<p>He turned to the secretary, who stood, with a grave
face, in front of him. Just what was in his mind
regarding the girl would have been rather hard to say.
But I knew he was remembering the statement of the
housekeeper—that she had said Warren ought to be
killed. Yet, as I looked at the beautiful girl before us,
with the bathing suit showing every line of her figure, I
decided that though she might have made the statement
it had meant nothing. Her face was frank and the gaze
which she gave us both was fearless.</p>

<p>“Florence,” said the chief slowly, “Mr. Warren was
found dead the evening you left.”</p>

<p>Her eyes opened wide in astonishment and she
gasped:</p>

<p>“Dead?”</p>

<p>He nodded gravely, then added:
“Worse—murdered.”</p>

<p>The girl's face whitened, and then slowly the color
flushed back into her cheeks until they were a vivid
red. For a moment she looked at us as if not believing
what had been said. Then slowly she went to a near-by
box and sank down upon it. There was no doubt she
was surprised and also horrified at the news she had
heard.</p>

<p>As she did not speak, the chief nervously shifted
his weight and threw a puzzled glance in my direction.
Purposely I turned my eyes away, and in a moment,
in an embarrassed voice, he said:</p>

<p>“You see, Florence, it's a bit awkward. You went
away from Mr. Warren's very suddenly.”</p>

<p>For the first time the girl showed a bit of temper, as
though it had just dawned upon her that the chief
would not have taken the long trip from the village just
to tell her Mr. Warren was dead. She spoke in a voice
a little nervous and at the same time sharp.</p>

<p>“Well, Suppose I did; that's my business, is it
not?”</p>

<p>The chief shook his head. “I am afraid not,” was
the slow response. “In a sense it's mine—now. You
see the remark you made to Mr. Warren's housekeeper
made it necessary to find you.”</p>

<p>She looked at him as if not understanding and then
half stammered: “What remark?”</p>

<p>“That Mr. Warren ought to be killed,” was the cold
reply.</p>

<p>As if realizing the seriousness of the chief's tone, the
girl's face went very white. Slowly her fingers opened
and closed; her eyes studied the water for a moment
as if she was trying to fix in her mind the distant shore.
Then she slowly raised her head and in a look which
included us both said:</p>

<p>“I did say that. But it was a very silly thing to say
and it meant nothing. Mr. Warren was alive when I
left him and, of course, I know nothing about his
death.”</p>

<p>As the girl hesitated, the chief broke in:</p>

<p>“I am not saying you did know anything about his
death. I only want to make you see how you placed
yourself in a bad position by going away and by the
remark you made. Why did you say it?”</p>

<p>The secretary gave a half laugh, though there was a
tone of disgust in it.</p>

<p>“It's all very simple. Mr. Warren was a very hard
man to work with. He was rushing his book and I was
working from ten to twelve hours a day. He paid
pretty well, of course, but once in a while he would get
mad and then he would sure bawl me out. The
afternoon I left we had a little disagreement.”</p>

<p>“What over?” was my question.</p>

<p>The girl gave me a surprised look. Remembering
that he had not given my name, the chief introduced me
as a friend of Carter's. Then the secretary replied:</p>

<p>“Two things. Mr. Warren had reached the place
where he was dictating a chapter about the social and
marriage customs of the natives of China.” She paused,
half blushed and went on:</p>

<p>“It was pretty frank, that chapter. Finally, he
decided I should copy some pages from a book he had.
He got the book from one of the cases—a case he kept
always locked. It was a pretty rotten book—so rotten
that I kicked a bit about copying the two pages. And
then he flared up and said that if I did not care to do
his work I could quit. And I got mad, and”—she
laughed a bit sheepishly—“I guess it was the warm day
got us both; anyway I got mad and left. I went to the
house, and when I was packing my grip, the more I
thought of it the madder I got. That's why I said the
foolish thing I did to the housekeeper.”</p>

<p>A cold flurry of wind came sweeping across the lake,
and I saw the girl shiver. It was getting late in the
afternoon. As I pulled out my watch to see the time,
the chief said the girl had better dress, and that we
would take her back to the village. As she seemed a
little startled at this remark, he told her she was the
only person who could tell us if anything had been
taken from Warren's library. This seemed to relieve
her a good deal, for there was little doubt in my mind
that she thought the chief was going to arrest her.
Saying she would be ready in a few moments, she rose
to her feet and went slowly to the cottage.</p>

<p>When she was out of hearing the chief turned to me:</p>

<p>“Mr. Pelt, I guess there is no doubt that girl is
telling the truth.”</p>

<p>I assured him it was my own idea. I added that as
Warren had not been killed until several hours after
she had left his grounds it would be absurd to even
think she knew anything about the murder. With a
little grunt of approval, the chief studied the water for
a while and we then turned to go to the car.</p>

<p>We had to wait a few moments and when the
secretary rejoined us she was followed by the other girls of
the camp. She had changed into a light summer dress
and as I saw her coming across the tall grass, I thought
again what a beautiful girl she was. The girls crowded
around the car as she took her seat behind me, but they
said little. I could tell by their serious faces that she
had told them of the death of Mr. Warren and that they
were not overpleased at the chief taking her away.
They all kissed her in turn, after the manner girls have
in saying good-by, and as we went around the bend in
the road our last sight was of their waving hands.</p>

<p>It was a silent ride to town—no one doing any
talking. For my part, it took all my skill to keep the car
on the road. It was with an inward sigh of relief that
I felt the firm concrete under the wheels when we
struck the main highway. Just as we were coming into
town the chief turned to tell the girl that he would
drop her off at her aunt's. And as we pulled up in
front of the white cottage he warned her not to talk to
any one and told her to be at his office by seven.</p>

<p>I dropped the chief at the police station. As he
climbed from the car, he stood a moment on the
sidewalk to say that he wanted me to go with him that
evening to Warren's. He was going to take the secretary
and have her tell him if anything had been disturbed.
So saying I would meet him at the summer house
around seven-thirty, I drove away.</p>

<p>As I parked the car in front of Carter's garage
Trouble gave one quick leap over the side and went on a run
up the steps to the veranda—barking at the top of his
lungs. I saw him jump at the figure of a man who half
rose from a chair, give one sudden, joyful bark, then
run to the grass, only to leap back to the veranda.
Wondering what had excited him, I got out of the car
and started for the house. And as I went up the
veranda steps, who should rise out of a chair and come
over to greet me but Bartley.</p>

<p>That I was surprised to see him was putting it
mildly. If I thought of him I pictured his sitting in
the hot courtroom in New York awaiting his chance to
testify. But here he was, very cool in his summer suit,
and with a little smile of welcome playing around his
fine lips. I rushed to his side and poured out my
surprise.</p>

<p>He laughed, saying that he had managed to get away
this morning. And then, as we both seated ourselves
my eyes went wandering around for Carter. Seeing
my glance, Bartley told me that Carter had been called
down to the city two hours before by an urgent
telegram from his chief. The two men, much to their
mutual surprise, had met at the station and Carter had
begged that Bartley stay at his house until he returned.
He expected to be back in two days.</p>

<p>Just as he finished saying this, Ranville came out of
the house. He and Bartley had met several times
before and I knew they both had a great admiration for
the other's ability. They joked a few minutes, and as
the housekeeper came to the door to announce dinner,
I hurried to my room for a quick wash.</p>

<p>Dinner turned out to be a lively meal. Under
Bartley's conversation Ranville warmed up far more than
I had seen before and the two men laughed and joked
at many of the experiences about which they spoke.
There was a decided contrast between them. Bartley's
hair, which had also started to turn white, gave his fine
face a very intellectual appearance. Ranville was far
the more nervous of the two, and his rather thin face
did not break into a smile as often as Bartley's.</p>

<p>For a time they talked of various places in Europe
where they had spent vacations. Then they mentioned
mutual acquaintances among the police officials of the
Continent; and this naturally led to the murder of
Warren.</p>

<p>Bartley informed us he had read all the papers had
said about the crime, adding that as he did not know
anything else, he had not formed an opinion. He
remarked that though all he had talked with at the club
were shocked at the sudden death of the scientist, their
greatest concern was over what would be done regarding
his book. And then with a laugh he said:</p>

<p>“You may be surprised, Ranville, to know there are
a good many people in this country who think that
Warren's taking off was an act of God.”</p>

<p>The Englishman gave him a look to see if he was
serious, then asked what he meant. Bartley half
laughed as he replied:</p>

<p>“Really, it's not laughable, Ranville, for it is a state
of mind which ought to have passed out in the Dark
Ages. But there are certain rabid, fanatical groups
which say in their weekly publications that God
punished Warren because of his stand on evolution.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the Scotland Yard Inspector gazed in a
blank manner across the table. I could see he did not
understand what Bartley was driving at. In a moment
he asked:</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Bartley's voice became serious. “You, perhaps, do
not understand just how extensive is the battle being
waged in this country against science. Little
theological leaders, without any knowledge of life or modern
thought, have been stirring up their followers in a
movement which is called ‘Fundamentalism.’ It is an
appeal to all the bigotry which lies in the heart of
uneducated people. Of course it is also a fear—a fear of
knowledge. But in this campaign there have been
many bitter things said. They are even trying to have
science outlawed by law. One religious weekly said
to-day, in a veiled editorial, that the taking off of
Warren at the time he was going to give his new proofs of
evolution to the world was an act of God.”</p>

<p>Ranville shrugged his shoulders as though the whole
thing was beyond his comprehension and, in fact, said
as much. Bartley agreed with him. He added, such
a thing was not understandable to any educated person
but admitted rather gravely that the educated people
were more or less outnumbered in our country.</p>

<p>As there came a pause in the conversation I
remembered that Carter had wired Washington regarding the
Chinaman who had visited us. I turned to Ranville to
ask if there had been a reply. He shook his head,
replying that nothing had arrived. As Bartley did not
understand what we were talking about, I informed
him, and he asked us what had been the substance of
the oriental's conversation. We told him how he
claimed to have found Warren dead with the dagger
still in the wound. He said nothing until we had
finished, then asked:</p>

<p>“What did he say was his object in calling on
Warren?”</p>

<p>“Some silly story about a box with the ashes of
Buddha in it,” drawled Ranville. “A yarn about
Buddha's body being burned when he died, and the
ashes being buried in seven places. Said Warren
walked away with one of the boxes of ashes.”</p>

<p>I saw a smile creep over Bartley's face as he asked:</p>

<p>“Just what was his story.”</p>

<p>The Englishman dropped two lumps of sugar into
his coffee and, taking his spoon, stirred it slowly; then
he replied:</p>

<p>“He said that when Buddha was dead they burned
his body and then divided the ashes into seven piles.
Buried them in seven different places. That's about
what he told us; seemed a silly yarn to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, Ranville,” replied Bartley, “it is all true.
Tradition said that the ashes of the great religious
teacher were placed in seven boxes and that seven
shrines were erected. Up until a few years ago the
scholars rather doubted the entire story; but they dug
into one of the reputed shrines in India a while ago
and found a box of gold and rare wood. It contained
ashes and a fragment of bone. They are pretty sure
it contained Buddha's ashes.”</p>

<p>“That's what he said,” commented Ranville. “And
then he went on to tell us Warren had picked up one
of those boxes in China. He wanted him to give it
back. Chinese were all heated up over it, or
something of that sort.”</p>

<p>“He said that Warren found one of them in China?”
was Bartley's question, and because of the surprise in
his tone we both looked at him.</p>

<p>“That's what he said,” retorted Ranville; “why?”</p>

<p>There was a slight frown on Bartley's face and,
pushing aside his coffee cup, he lighted a long thin
cigar. Then he turned to the Englishman.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said, “simply this, Ranville. There were
seven reputed shrines of Buddha. Not all of them are
known. But the seven shrines in which were buried a
portion of his ashes were in India. There was not one
in China. And—”</p>

<p>Ranville was always unruffled and I had failed to see
him excited. Even the discovery of Warren's body had
not caused any apparent show of emotion. But at
Bartley's remark he gave a sudden start and I saw his
lips tighten. He turned quickly to say:</p>

<p>“Then when he said that he lied.”</p>

<p>Bartley was thoughtful a moment, replying slowly:</p>

<p>“If he told you Warren returned from China with a
box containing part of the ashes of Buddha he must
have lied. At the present time the scholars almost all
agree that the discovery made by digging into the
shrine in India I told you of is true. That is, they
accept the tradition that the ashes of Buddha were
divided into seven parts and buried in seven places. They
go further and say that the box they found no doubt
contains the ashes of the great teacher—part of them.
But so far as I know there has never been any other
box of ashes discovered; and it is absurd to say that
Warren found them in China, for the ashes were all
buried in India. When he said that, he must have lied,
or else—”</p>

<p>“He was too smooth an article to be mistaken,” was
my comment, to which Ranville nodded his assent.</p>

<p>“No doubt,” was Bartley's retort. “But there is one
thing sure; he did not tell you the real reason for his
visit to Warren's library.”</p>

<p>“I doubt if he told the truth regarding finding the
body,” was my contribution.</p>

<p>“You know,” broke in Ranville, “we people at
Scotland Yard are often accused of being slow. But there
is one thing sure. We would have locked that
Chinaman up and kept him for a while. His story sounded
good. But at the same time he was the last person
who went to the library around the time of the murder.
And thinking it over now, there is another thing I want
to know. He said the door was open and he walked in.
If that's true, who closed it afterward? And what's
more, who took the knife from the body? That was a
silly thing to do after the murderer went away.”</p>

<p>Bartley gave him a long look and slowly repeated
the word, silly, then became silent. Ranville and I
entered into an argument as to whether the man had
gone to the chief of police, as we suggested, and told
him the story. Ranville had just said he would wager
the chief had not seen him when the word “chief” made
me give a quick look at my watch and remember that
I was to meet him at Warren's library at seven-thirty.
One glance told me it was now fifteen minutes past the
hour. I arose with a sudden exclamation.</p>

<p>As I pushed back my chair, both men looked at me
in surprise. In a few words I told where I was going,
and Bartley at once suggested that he would go with
us, to which the Englishman added his assent. We
found our hats, went out on the lawn and, finding the
Airedale running back and forth, locked him in the
garage. The next moment we were in the car and a
second later drove out of the yard.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch10">

<h2>Chapter X. <br> The Face at the Window</h2>

<p>As we went up the hill which led to the eight-sided
building in which we had found the murdered scientist,
we concluded the chief had arrived. The lights were
streaming out of the windows and the front door was
slightly open. As we passed within the chief came over
from the desk in the center of the room. I introduced
him to Bartley and he shook his hand with evident
pleasure.</p>

<p>For a few moments the two men talked. The chief
told us the room was untouched from the night of the
crime. After we had left he had stationed one of his
policemen in the library. He said that he did not want
the place overrun with people, and he knew that until
the secretary had been found there was no way for him
to tell if anything was missing. The room had not
been entered by any one, though there had been
hundreds of people drawn by curiosity who had wished to
look within.</p>

<p>Bartley's eyes swept around the book-lined walls and
then came to rest on the big desk in the center of the
room. I told him where we had found the body and he
slowly walked over to the place I pointed out. The
chairs were just as we had found them and I mentioned
what Ranville had said regarding the murderer
sitting across from Warren. He slowly nodded his head
in approval and then, turning, his keen eyes saw the
broken glass in the bookcase.</p>

<p>I told him we had found it in that condition; and he
went over to the case and, bending down, looked at the
contents. Pulling first one and then another of the
thin books from the case, he glanced at their title page,
only to return them to the shelf. He spent some little
time at the row which had the gaps in it, and I saw
him half frown as he looked at every book on that shelf.
He was just starting to say something when a voice
from the door called:</p>

<p>“I hope I have not kept you waiting.”</p>

<p>We turned to see the secretary coming across the
floor. She had changed her light dress for one of some
darker material, and her face was very serious. As
she cast a glance at the desk, I saw her shudder, and
her cheeks grew a little pale. But there was nothing
of fear in the frank glance she gave the chief and the
rather curious look which went over Bartley and
Ranville. The chief introduced her to the two men, and in
a few words told them what she had said had been
the reason she left her work so suddenly. When he
had finished her face flushed as she spoke:</p>

<p>“I have been thinking ever since you told me of Mr.
Warren's death how very foolish I was to have used
the expression that I did. I never meant anything by
it—simply let my temper run away with me.”</p>

<p>I saw Bartley's cool glance as he studied her, and
then there came a little smile around his lips as he
said:</p>

<p>“Miss Harlan, it is the privilege of young women to
lose their tempers. Only in your case it happened
that what you said became public. I am sure the chief
will agree with me that you are sorry you said what
you did; but though there will naturally fall some
suspicion because of your going away, yet I think we can
take care of that.”</p>

<p>The chief nodded and a grateful look swept over the
girl's face. I judged from her expression that it had
come over her the last few hours in what a peculiar
situation she was in. That she knew the slightest thing
about the murder, I doubted. And I knew from
Bartley's expression he felt the same way. Just what
the chief might think I could not tell. His heavy face
wore a rather bewildered look and as he glanced around
the room it struck me that he hardly knew what his
next step should be.</p>

<p>Bartley must have sensed the chief's feeling, for he
turned, saying:</p>

<p>“Chief, I have had a great deal of experience in these
kinds of cases; I thought perhaps you might let me ask
Miss Harlan a few questions. It has been a difficult
afternoon for her, and she needs a little rest. Perhaps
I can gain all the information she has to give in a few
moments.”</p>

<p>The chief jumped at the suggestion and Bartley,
turning to the girl, asked her to tell us in detail just
what she and Warren did in the hours they passed in
the library. There was not much to tell. Warren was
working over his notes—the notes of his expedition to
Mongolia. He would dictate a chapter which she
would type, and then he would go over it and correct
it. The book, she judged, was half done, for he had
told her the day before she left him that the most
important half was coming. I judged from what she said
that there had been no regular hours for work;
sometimes they would work until late in the evening;
sometimes they would stop at six.</p>

<p>“Did you have many callers at the library?” asked
Bartley.</p>

<p>“No one,” was the reply. “Mr. Warren refused to
see any one here. Sometimes some one would come, but
I always met them and they never even got within the
room.”</p>

<p>“How about the telephone?” questioned Ranville.
“I see there are two.”</p>

<p>She nodded. “Yes, one connects directly with the
house; the housekeeper used that to get Mr. Warren.
The other ran outside. But there were not many calls
that came through—maybe two or three a day,
sometimes not even one.”</p>

<p>There was a little smile around Bartley's lips as he
asked the next question. But it was a very pleasing
smile—one which caused the serious look to leave the
girl's face.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Harlan, you say that the work was
rather hard, that you sometimes were here twelve and
fourteen hours a day. I judge also Mr. Warren was
not the easiest person to work with. Now, tell us just
what happened the afternoon you left him—what made
you angry.”</p>

<p>The secretary's face reddened, but her eyes met
Bartley's bravely. “You are right when you say Mr.
Warren was not easy to work for, but perhaps—it was
more my fault than his. He was a very nervous man
whose mind worked very quickly. I had never done
this kind of work before. Not only were the terms he
used in dictating new to me, but there were long lists of
references which I had to verify. The afternoon of
his death I had been planning to go to a dance in the
evening. About three o'clock Mr. Warren told me we
would work until ten; that made me a little angry.
Then he decided he wanted to have two pages copied
from one of the books in that case.”</p>

<p>She pointed to the case with the broken door and,
seeing our inquiring look, explained:</p>

<p>“It was not broken when I left. Mr. Warren always
kept that case locked. But he sent me for a book and
when I got it he found two pages that I was to copy in
his notes. I started to look at the book and there were
pictures in it.” Her face flushed very red as the
recollection came to her.</p>

<p>“Pictures?” asked Bartley. “What have they to do
with it?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps nothing, sir,” was her quick response. “I
was pretty tired, and it was warm. Naturally, I felt
disappointed over having to work until ten. And then
I saw those pictures, and they were very bad—I never
saw anything like them.”</p>

<p>She paused, then went on quickly: “Mr. Warren
asked me what was the matter and I told him. He
said he did not hire me to comment on the morality
of his books and that led me to get angry. I told him
I had a good mind to leave him. He laughed and said
he judged he could find a good many better typists than
myself. So—so I simply told him I was through. I
went to the house and got my bag. You know the
rest.”</p>

<p>“What was the book?” was Bartley's question.</p>

<p>“De Sade's ‘Justine’—the third volume.”</p>

<p>“And did you place it back in the case?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “No, I locked the case and gave
the key to Mr. Warren. But the volume was on the
desk when I left.”</p>

<p>We had looked the desk over after the murder, but
there had been no book of that description. It would
have been easy to have seen it, because of the shape
and because the books in that case were almost all bound
in white vellum or red morocco. I told Bartley this,
and he went over to the case, returning with a book—a
book bound in red—which he simply handed to me. It
was the first volume of the original ten-volume edition
of De Sade's work. I gave it one look and said that I
had not seen it on the desk.</p>

<p>He turned to the girl. “It was bound like this, was
it not?”</p>

<p>“No,” was her rather surprising answer. “It was
not. There were six books in the set. Mr. Warren said
that the last eight volumes were bound two to a book.
For some reason the second volume and the other four
were bound in white. This one was red—the only one
of the set with that color for a cover.”</p>

<p>I saw a curious smile play over Bartley's face.
Slowly, he turned the pages of the book, and then to
my surprise he placed it in his pocket. Then, turning
to the girl, he asked:</p>

<p>“Now, did any one call the library on the telephone
during the afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Two people, both men. I do not know who they
were. Mr. Warren answered the phone. I don't even
know what they wanted.”</p>

<p>“And do you know if Mr. Warren was expecting any
visitor?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of,” was her response. “In fact
I doubt it very much.”</p>

<p>Though other questions were asked her, she knew
nothing more of value. She did say the windows and
the door were left open while they were working, but
that Mr. Warren had them closed every evening. When
she left the library the windows were all open and she
could not account for any reason why they should be
closed. Then, at our request, she went carefully over
the room in an attempt to discover if anything had
been disturbed. But when she had finished, she was
forced to admit that nothing had been touched.</p>

<p>For a moment after she made this statement we
stood silent, wondering just what our next move could
be; and then came Bartley's voice:</p>

<p>“Miss Harlan, where did Mr. Warren keep his
manuscript and the notes of his trip to China?”</p>

<p>She pointed to the large safe which stood near the
door. As Bartley went over to look at it, I followed
him. It was a rather large safe and, as I expected, it
was locked. Bartley stood looking at it a moment,
only to turn when the girl said:</p>

<p>“I know the combination, Mr. Bartley. Mr.
Warren had me lock it every night. Also open it at times.
He always used the same combination.”</p>

<p>At the chief's suggestion she came over to the safe
and, bending down, fumbled for a moment or so with
the lock. The first time she tried she did not get the
right combination, but the next trial resulted in the door
being opened. The interior of the safe was of the usual
type, save for the fact that there seemed far more
space than is usual. This open space at the lower half
was filled with a mass of papers which no one disturbed.
At Bartley's request after his short examination she
closed the safe, giving him the combination which he
wrote down in a little red note book.</p>

<p>We slowly returned to the center of the room, no
one speaking. The girl's story had added little, if
anything, to our knowledge. So far as we could tell
nothing in the room had been disturbed or even
touched. As to gaining any knowledge which would
aid us in solving the mystery of Warren's death, we
were in the same position as before. I think the chief
was thinking this, for I saw him glance slowly around
the room and then shake his head. And then
Ranville's voice broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Miss Harlan, there is just one thing you might
explain. You said that you were angry because Mr.
Warren wished you to work until ten o'clock. Did you
expect he was to be with you in the library?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply. “In fact, I knew he would not
have been. He had a dinner he was giving to three
men. But there were notes which had to be typed. He
would have corrected the manuscript the next
morning. That's why I would have had to stay so late. He
was in a hurry to finish the book, you know.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” came the drawling voice of the Englishman.
“And now did you ever hear some silly story about
Mr. Warren having a box with the bone—excuse
me—the ashes of Buddha in it?”</p>

<p>The girl's eyes grew large as she gazed at Ranville.
I could see that she thought he was joking, and at his
next remark her eyes grew even larger as he asked:</p>

<p>“And did any Chinaman come around here to see
Mr. Warren?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, saying she knew nothing of
either a Chinaman or a box with ashes in it. It was
clear she did not even understand what he was talking
about, for she glanced at both the chief and Bartley as
if asking for information. But instead of replying the
chief reached into his pocket and came forth with a
long envelope. Very slowly he opened it and brought
forth a piece of paper. As I saw the torn sheet, I
recognized it. It was the letter I had found on the desk.
Approaching the girl and holding the letter where she
could read it, he asked:</p>

<p>“Did you ever see that?”</p>

<p>She carefully read the few lines, and then shook her
head. Bartley's hand went out for the sheet of paper
and as he took it I told him where we had found it.
He said nothing for a moment, then turned to the girl:</p>

<p>“Did you open Mr. Warren's mail?” he asked.</p>

<p>“As a rule I did. I never saw that letter. And I
never heard anything about a Chinaman or any box of
ashes of any kind.”</p>

<p>As Bartley gazed at his watch he said that it was
rather late, and that perhaps Ranville would be willing
to drive the secretary home in our car. Ranville
nodded his assent and said that he would come back
for us, to which Bartley replied by saying that we
could walk back to the house. As the Englishman and
the girl started for the door Bartley, who was by the
desk, bent forward to pick something from the floor.
Then he called to the secretary.</p>

<p>“Miss Harlan, who cleaned this room?”</p>

<p>She had reached the door, but turned to answer him.</p>

<p>“Why, Jimmy—the man who works around the
grounds. He swept every morning before we came to
work.”</p>

<p>“Did he clean the room the day of the murder?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was here when I came; had just finished.”
She paused, waiting for another question, but instead
Bartley said “Good night,” and she went outside. When
she had gone, he turned to the chief and myself.</p>

<p>“I picked this up on the floor,” he said, holding some
object in his hand. We came closer to see what
it was. As we looked we saw a small bone hairpin,
which we gazed at without speaking. As he placed it in
his pocket, he said:</p>

<p>“It may not mean a single thing. The secretary has
her hair bobbed, so, of course, she does not use
hairpins. But if the man cleaned up the place the
morning of the murder he must have overlooked this.”</p>

<p>No one made any reply, and the chief stood looking
rather moodily at the desk. Then he asked:</p>

<p>“What do you think about that letter?”</p>

<p>Instead of replying, Bartley walked over to the
typewriting stand. The typewriter was covered, but he took
the cover off. Finding a piece of blank paper, he
placed it in the machine and struck several of the keys,
then wrote a sentence. He turned to ask that the
chief let him see the letter, and then evidently copied
something from it. Pulling from the machine the sheet
upon which he had written, he compared the two for a
moment. Then he said.</p>

<p>“I do not know, chief, what to say regarding that
letter. It was written on this machine, however.”</p>

<p>There came a grunt from the chief, and the
words:</p>

<p>“It was?”</p>

<p>“Yes. There is no doubt of it. This machine is a
bit out of alignment; the letters ‘e’ and ‘a’ are very
much worn. You will find the same markings in the
letter you found on the desk and in the copy I struck
off.”</p>

<p>A comparison of the two sheets of paper convinced
the chief and me that they had, indeed, been written
upon the same typewriter, the one upon the stand
before us. The letters Bartley mentioned were a little
worn and both copies showed the same markings. Not
only that, the ribbon was rather old, and the type bars
seemed out of alignment. As we saw these facts, the
chief well expressed my opinion when he said in a
very amazed voice:</p>

<p>“I guess you are right. But what under heavens does
it mean?”</p>

<p>Bartley reached for his cigar case, and then he
handed it to us. We all took a cigar and after Bartley
had lighted his he said:</p>

<p>“I can only tell you what I think it might mean,
Chief. The letter was written after Warren was
killed—written to be discovered.”</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” was the query.</p>

<p>“Well, it seems very logical to say that if the person
who wrote it had not wished any one to see it, he or
she would have destroyed the entire letter. To simply
tear off the signature—if there was one—meant
nothing. If they wished to have no one see the letter they
would have destroyed it all. Then, it is written on this
typewriter. The secretary says that no one was in the
library during the time she was here on that last day.
I do not think she wrote it; the murderer might have
done so, and if so, he wrote it to make you think just
what you did think.”</p>

<p>As the chief's eyes expressed his wonder, Bartley
added:</p>

<p>“Suppose, for instance, that the person who killed
Warren did it in a sudden fit of frenzy. Then, when
the deed was over, there came the second cooler
thought—he had committed a murder. Criminals, that
is, all that I know, always make mistakes. This one
realized he was pretty safe, but he thought he had
better make it safer, throw suspicion on some one else.
Seeing the typewriter, he wrote that part of the letter
you see, and left it where he knew some one would find
it. And by doing that he defeated the very thing he
wanted us to think. For if he had not left that portion,
we would not have known anything about it. It is a
very mysterious murder at the best, and this makes it
more so.”</p>

<p>“You're right when you say it is a mysterious
murder,” shot forth the chief. “It's damned mysterious.
And here am I—without any clews, without any sort of
a chance to solve it. There is nothing missing even
from the room.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there is,” came Bartley's quick comment.</p>

<p>“There is not,” answered the chief. “That girl
knows the room, everything in it. She says there is
nothing missing.”</p>

<p>“But then she is mistaken,” was the cool reply.</p>

<p>As the chief started to speak, he went on:</p>

<p>“The girl told you the truth, and yet she is mistaken.
There is something missing. It is the rest of that
edition of De Sade,” and he pointed to the red-covered
book which he placed on the surface of the desk.</p>

<p>The chief's eyes went to the book, but he glanced at
it as if he did not believe what Bartley had said. Then,
as he turned, he burst out:</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“This, Chief. I happen to know about this edition
of De Sade's ‘Justine.’ It is not very common, though
it is very famous; perhaps I had better say ‘infamous.’
The original edition was in ten small volumes with one
hundred illustrations—illustrations as bad as the text.
The author, a pathological case, spent most of his time
in insane asylums, sent there first by Napoleon. He
was not insane, however, in the strict sense of the word.
Now, as I said, there were ten volumes. The secretary
said that the last eight volumes of the set Mr. Warren
had were bound two to a book; the first two were not.”</p>

<p>There was a perplexed look on the chief's face. He
was trying to follow Bartley, but did not seem to
understand just what it was all about. Seeing this, Bartley
explained:</p>

<p>“What I mean is this. Mr. Warren's set contained
six bound books. Five of them, the girl said, were
bound in white vellum. The first volume was bound
in red morocco. That case was locked during the
afternoon. Some one smashed the glass, so it could not
have been Mr. Warren who took the books. They took
what they thought was the entire set or edition. But
they made a mistake, a natural one—”</p>

<p>“What was that?” came the chief's insistent voice.</p>

<p>“A very logical and very simple mistake. They saw
the books were all bound in white vellum; so they
were—all but the first volume—that was red morocco. They
took the five books thinking they had the set, but left
the red one behind. No doubt they were so upset they
did not think of looking very closely. But they took
the books all right. That is what is missing from the
room.”</p>

<p>“But, my God, Mr. Bartley,” broke in the chief, “no
one would murder a man for five books.”</p>

<p>Bartley laughed. “If you knew the history of crime,
Chief, you would know there have been several
murders over a book. One man not only killed his best
friend to secure the possession of a rare book he had,
but burned his house after the crime. Yet in a sense
you are right. I fail to understand why any one should
kill Warren for this particular set.”</p>

<p>“Are they worth much?” I asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “Not much as rare books go.
The work has been reprinted under cover. You can
buy it for about twenty-five dollars in Europe. I doubt
if the original edition is worth over two hundred. And
the type of man who would steal that sort of a book
after committing a murder is—”</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused as if a new thought had suddenly
come to him, but what it was he did not say. There
came the voice of the chief, and there was such a
complaining tone in his voice that I almost laughed.</p>

<p>“You know, Mr. Bartley, this thing has me all upset.
There has not been a murder in the village for years
and years. Now comes this thing and the papers are
full of it. What to do I do not know. And there
seems to be no reason on earth why Mr. Warren was
murdered.”</p>

<p>No one made any reply to his plaintive remark, and
there came a silence for a moment which he broke by
saying:</p>

<p>“I forgot to tell Florence that I had a long distance
call from that man who is going to finish Mr.
Warren's book—Patton, I think the name was. He wants
her to act as his secretary, like she did for Warren; said
that she knew more about his papers than any one else.
But then I can get her in the morning.”</p>

<p>There seemed to be little more that we could do, and
we started for the door; before we reached it the chief
asked:</p>

<p>“Do you think, Mr. Bartley, that the murderer
closed those windows which were found locked?”</p>

<p>“There seems no reason why he should have done it,”
was the reply. “I would say that Mr. Warren had
closed them himself. He must have been just on the
verge of leaving for the house to get ready for dinner.
Let us say he had closed the windows for the night
when some one came. There would be no real reason
why the murderer should have closed them.”</p>

<p>As he paused, I turned to glance at the windows.
They were placed above the bookcases—one window
for each of the eight sides of the building. And then,
as my eyes went to the central window, I gave a gasp
and then a sudden cry. For there, peering through the
window, was a face—a face whose outlines were far
from plain. But I could see the hat pulled low over
the eyes, and the eyes themselves, which seemed to
meet my own. For an instant I saw them, and as our
glance met, the face disappeared. But for a second I
had seen it—a man's face peering through the central
window into the room.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch11">

<h2>Chapter XI. <br> The Gardener Speaks</h2>

<p>My glance at the window had been but a casual
thing and the appearance of the face had lasted only a
second. As the face vanished, I uttered a sudden
cry—one which caused Bartley to give me a quick look.
Briefly I told what I had seen, and pointed at the
window; then we turned and rushed for the door and
out into the open air.</p>

<p>The library stood upon the top of a small hill, and
there were no trees within a short distance. At the
bottom of the hill, however, the lawn was covered with
trees and shrubbery. It was dark, yet not so dark but
that we should have been able to have seen any figure
which ran across our vision. But save for the trees in
the distance, which loomed a darker shadow against the
blackness, we saw nothing. Bartley motioned with his
hand and we followed him to the rear of the house.</p>

<p>Here, too, there was a close-cropped lawn with the
trees commencing on the far edge. The trees were
thicker and the shrubbery far more dense than in the
front. It needed but a look to realize that it was
absurd to expect to discover any one in the darkness. The
huge lawn, together with the many trees, offered many
opportunities for hiding. Just as I was about to say this
there came a sharp exclamation of surprise and the
sound of two people tumbling through the hedge far to
our left.</p>

<p>The path to the library ran between two rows of a
high hedge. As we rushed across the grass, the sounds
of the struggle came louder to our ears. Two people
were thrashing back and forth upon the ground
slightly ahead of us. As we reached the path and
turned past the slight bend, we almost stumbled over
two men—two men rolling to and fro on the gravel.</p>

<p>We could dimly distinguish their figures as they
struggled. Save for the crunching of the gravel in the
path and their hurried breathing, they made no sound.
Over and over, first one on top and then the other, they
rolled. The chief and Bartley rushed in to separate
them. As Bartley's hand reached the man who for the
moment was on top there came Ranville's voice.</p>

<p>“Just grab hold of this chap under me, will you?”</p>

<p>The chief pulled the other man to his feet as
Ranville stood erect. I heard him brushing the dirt from
his clothes and then he laughed:</p>

<p>“I was coming up this confounded path when that
blighter ran smash into me; almost knocked me off my
feet. And when I asked him what the rush was, he
tried to knock me down. Naturally enough, I
decided we'd better have a look at him.”</p>

<p>Pushing the man ahead of him, the chief started back
to the library, we following him. No one said
anything, and whoever the man might be, he kept his
mouth shut. Up the steps to the piazza and then
through the open door we marched. When we were in
the room, the chief whirled the man around to get a
look at his face. It needed but one glance to tell who
he was. The heavy, dull face turned toward us and
filled with fear was that of the man who worked
around Warren's grounds.</p>

<p>He was a thick-set man whose features at the inquest
had not impressed me very highly. No one, looking at
him at any time, would have said he was very
imposing, either in intelligence or physique; now, with his
face streaked with dirt from the path in which he had
rolled, and with the blood trickling from a slight cut
above his eye, he made a rather sinister appearance.
The dark hair was a tangled mass, and his eyes glared
at us as he half yelled:</p>

<p>“What are you trying to do to me? I ain't done
nothing.”</p>

<p>“What were you looking through the window for?”
growled the chief.</p>

<p>Though I was pretty sure that the gardener was the
man whose face I had seen at the window a few
moments before, yet I was not positive; his next words,
however, were a confession:</p>

<p>“Suppose I was?” he snarled. “There is no harm in
that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” retorted the chief. “But you were
pretty anxious to get away without being seen.”</p>

<p>“You're right there, Officer,” laughed Ranville. “He
was running as fast as he could when he banged into
me.”</p>

<p>Ranville was wearing a light summer suit—a suit
remarkable, not only for the fineness of the cloth, but
also for the way it was pressed; now it was a mass of
wrinkles, stained and soiled from the dirt. But though
the face of the Englishman had a dark streak which
ran from his eyes to his lips, yet from his manner one
would never have thought that only a moment or so
before he had been struggling with the gardener.</p>

<p>His remark caused the chief to make a vain attempt
to wring from the man the reason why he had been
looking in the window, and also why he had run away.
But the gardener refused to make any explanations.
He would simply shrug his shoulders, or else growl out
that he had done nothing. In the end the chief, by this
time a very angry man, announced he would lock him
up in the jail for the night.</p>

<p>“Maybe by morning you will feel like talking,” was
the statement he hurled at the gardener.</p>

<p>We waited until after the chief had called the police
station and asked them to send a car for his prisoner.
Then bidding him good night, we left the library and
started for our car. As we walked down the path,
Ranville told us that though we had said we would
walk back to the house, yet it had taken so little time
to reach the secretary's home that he had come back
to pick us up. He had just started up the path to the
library when he heard running footsteps and the next
second the man had plunged against him. The two
men had rolled over and over and as the man seemed
determined to get away, Ranville had decided that he
had better discover who he might be.</p>

<p>All the way back to the house we discussed the
matter, reaching no conclusion. How long the gardener
had been watching us or for what reason we could
not say. Ranville was more interested in endeavoring
to find out why the man had attempted to get away
without being seen. To him that was the suspicious
thing. Otherwise he would have seen no reason to
become excited over the fact the man had looked in the
window. Curiosity could explain that action. It would
not, however, explain his effort to escape without being
seen. We were still talking about it when we drove
into the yard.</p>

<p>Telling Bartley that I would place the car in the
garage, I let the two men out by the drive, noticing as I
did so that the lights were turned on in the house.
The dog leaped with a bark to greet me as I opened the
garage door and followed me when I went into the
house. Hearing the sound of voices in the living room,
I entered to find Bartley talking with Carter's
neighbor, the minister.</p>

<p>Seating myself in a chair, I listened to the
conversation. I could tell the clergyman did not have the
slightest idea who Bartley might be. I judged also
that he was a little surprised at not finding Carter at
home. There was a great contrast between the two
men. The minister was very tall and thin and
extremely nervous. His eyes looked tired, and there was
a certain condescension in his voice which I have
noticed in other men of his profession. Bartley, on the
other hand, leaned back in his chair with the restful air
which he always wore. His keen, intellectual face had
not a single line, and though I judged the two men were
about the same age, Bartley looked at least ten years
younger.</p>

<p>For a while they talked in the idle fashion men do
when they are strangers. Then for a time they spoke
about certain books. In the end, naturally enough, they
came to Warren's death. It was the clergyman who
brought up the subject by saying that he judged they
would never find the murderer. Bartley made no
response to this, but went on to say that the death of the
scientist was a very deplorable thing for the intellectual
world. And to my surprise the minister promptly said
that he did not agree with this. And then suddenly he
began to talk very earnestly.</p>

<p>Long before he had finished I discovered that the
man was very narrow to say the least. He informed
us that though he was sorry to have heard of Mr.
Warren's being murdered, yet, after all, he considered
it an act of God. I gave a start at this, for they were
the very words Bartley had told us had been used in
the editorial he had read in a religious journal. As the
minister uttered them, I saw a rather dismayed smile
flit over Bartley's face, and he half protested.</p>

<p>The face of the minister lightened with strange
intensity. His face flushed with eagerness as he leaned
forward to say:</p>

<p>“I know, of course, the phrase does not sound well.
But you do not know as I do how the materialistic
teachings of the scientists are undermining the faith
of our young people. These men are destroying the
very word of God. Mr. Warren said that his new book
would settle for all time the question of evolution.”</p>

<p>He paused to give a scornful laugh.</p>

<p>“Of course, he was wrong there. Evolution is
simply a guess of man and can never be proven to be
right. But his book might have caused much confusion
among the unthinking people. Now it can never be
written.”</p>

<p>Bartley started to say something but checked
himself and slumped far down in his chair. At this
moment Ranville came into the room. He had changed
his suit and with a nod to the minister took a chair
near me. The minister eyed the Englishman for a
second, then turned to carry on the strange argument.
He bent forward with an intensity of feeling and
swept on:</p>

<p>“You men do not realize as some of we clergymen
do just how evil have become the times in which we
are living. The young people of to-day have no
interest in sacred things. Pleasure and materialism are
sweeping over us; if it is not checked, God will blot
us out just as he did in the time of Noah.”</p>

<p>I saw Ranville's eyes open wide in astonishment.
He gave the excited man in the chair a look and
drawled out:</p>

<p>“Really now, you can't mean all that.”</p>

<p>The minister brought his thin hand down upon the
arm of his chair. His voice rose a little and became
sharper as he replied:</p>

<p>“But I do, I do. There is a wave of irreligion sweeping
over the world. Most of it is due to the materialistic
teaching of the so-called ‘men of science.’ Their
absurd theory of evolution, which teaches that man is
a brute instead of a son of God, is responsible for a
good deal of it.”</p>

<p>Ranville gave a little puzzled shake of his head and
looked at the minister as though he was studying a new
sort of animal. Then he asked:</p>

<p>“Well, how do you expect to stop all the scientific
teaching?”</p>

<p>The minister almost jumped from his chair as he
cried:</p>

<p>“We are going to stop it! We must! We have
millions of God-fearing people behind us. Before we are
through, we will prevent the teaching of evolution by
law. Make it a crime to put materialistic theories in
the minds of the young.”</p>

<p>Bartley's eyes met those of Ranville and the two
men faintly smiled. I looked at the minister, hardly
thinking he believed what he was saying. It needed,
however, but a glance at the thin face and the fixed
determined lips to see that he was in earnest. There
was a certain look in his eyes that I did not like—the
look of the fanatic. But just when I had thought of
that his expression changed and there came a smile
around his lips—a smile which made his face almost
attractive. He half laughed as he said:</p>

<p>“Well, I was getting started on my hobby. It is all
true what I have said. Religion is dying out under the
sweep of materialistic things. Why in the ten churches
in this town—churches which will seat around four
thousand people—there were only 540 in them all last
Sunday. But—” He hesitated, and then went on:
“But I don't want you to take what I said amiss. I
am very sorry Mr. Warren was killed. But in a sense
to me it seems that if such a thing had to happen, it was
good it came when it did.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” came Ranville's
surprised question.</p>

<p>“Why now that book of his will never be published,”
was the retort.</p>

<p>There came Bartley's cool voice:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it will. Niles Patton, who was Warren's
assistant on the trip into China, is to arrive to-morrow.
He will finish editing Warren's notes. The book will
be out all right.”</p>

<p>I saw a very surprised look sweep across the
minister's face, and there came a slight frown. But he
said nothing for a minute, and when he did speak, it
was to ask if we thought the Chinaman who had been
mentioned at the inquest, had anything to do with the
murder. He was told we did not know, and then for
some reason the conversation died away. Inviting us
to call at his house, he bade us good night and went
out.</p>

<p>After his footsteps had died away, Ranville turned
to Bartley with a little laugh and asked:</p>

<p>“Do you have many like him?”</p>

<p>“Far more than you think,” was the serious reply.
“In fact, Ranville, he told the truth. There are
millions in this country who are trying to have laws passed
which will prevent the teaching of science. We have
three great religious denominations that maintain great
political lobbies in Washington. They may be narrow,
uncultured and all that, but they are also sincere—the
sincerity of the uneducated, and those who from the
standpoint of the psychologist fear the newer
knowledge. They want Sunday blue laws, censorship and,
above all, to prevent by law all things in which they
do not believe. He was right when he said that many
of those people think Warren's death was an act of
God.”</p>

<p>Ranville shook his head as if saying that such things
were beyond his comprehension. He laughed a bit, and
had a little fun with us by saying that it was time we
became civilized; then lapsed into silence. For a time
we sat quietly thinking, the smoke from our cigars
curling above our heads. It was Ranville who spoke
first, turning to Bartley:</p>

<p>“What do you think was back of this murder?”</p>

<p>“It is going to be pretty hard to discover. I suppose
you Scotland Yard men always do the same thing I
do, try first to find the motive for a crime.”</p>

<p>The Inspector nodded, replying:</p>

<p>“We do. But of course we have an extensive system
which covers the whole of England. Even at that it
would be rather difficult to find any apparent motive
for this murder. There is none on the surface.”</p>

<p>“None that we usually find. Warren had no relative
except his brother in the south. He is a very wealthy
man, and the property will go to him. No family
troubles. It seems from all we have heard he was not
killed for money. There was nothing of any value
taken. On the other hand, he had no enemies so far as
I ever heard; in fact, the more you look at it the
greater becomes the mystery. Just why a man like
Warren should have been killed is the question we
must answer first. Until that is answered there can
be no chance of answering the second—who killed
him.”</p>

<p>The Englishman was thoughtful for a while, and then
sinking back in his chair said slowly:</p>

<p>“That is true. The only thing we do not know about
is what might have taken place in China.”</p>

<p>“I know about that,” commented Bartley, and as
we both looked at him in surprise, he added:</p>

<p>“I ran into Niles Patton at the University Club
yesterday. I have known Patton for a long time. He was
with Warren in China. He says that they had no
trouble at all on their expedition. The only reason they
were delayed in returning was not because they were
molested by outlaws, but on account of the great
discoveries of fossils Warren made. He says that so far
as he knows Warren did not have an enemy in the
whole of China. You will meet him when he comes up
here to finish Warren's notes, and he will tell you the
same thing.”</p>

<p>“But, John,” I ventured. “How about that
Chinaman who visited us and the story he told?”</p>

<p>Bartley threw out his hands in a gesture of
hopelessness and said that he could not answer the
question. For a while we commented about his visit, and
agreed with Bartley the man had lied to us when he
spoke about a box which contained the ashes of
Buddha. It was Ranville's opinion that the Chinaman
had come more to discover what we knew than any
other reason. He was rather insistent that the man
should have been held by the police. And then I
remembered that I had not told Bartley of my visit to
the swamp and of the attack which had been made on
me at the church tower.</p>

<p>He listened soberly, smiled once or twice as
something struck him as being humorous, and opened his
eyes when I narrated how I was thrown over the tower.
He laughed when I told him of the amazed look upon
the minister's face as he heard my voice and opened
the trap door. But he did not make any comment,
saying that it was rather an odd thing to have taken place.</p>

<p>As Bartley did not comment on my accident,
Ranville after a pause asked him if he had any kind of a
theory about the case. I saw Bartley's lips melt into a
firm line, and he turned to the Englishman.</p>

<p>“I have no theory at all, Ranville. It seems to me
that there is something we do not know—some little
thing, perhaps, which might give the light we need.
What it is I cannot even guess. You know that our
work is one-third brains and perhaps two-thirds luck.
As this case now stands, all the brains we may use upon
it will not aid us unless luck plays a little part. Plays
it by giving that little clew—the hint which would
cause us to discover what the motive might be
or find the type of a person who might have killed
Warren.”</p>

<p>The telephone bell interrupted him. It was a long,
incessant ring. I went into the hall, and in a moment
there came the voice of the chief asking for Bartley.
Telling him to wait, I returned to the living room and
said that the chief was calling. With a half smile
Bartley rose to his feet and went out into the hall. We
heard the low murmur of his voice, and the
conversation was rather long. When it ceased, he came slowly
back and dropped into a chair. There was a rather
perplexed look on his face as he turned to us.</p>

<p>“The chief called up to tell me he has succeeded in
getting the gardener to talk. And the chief, I might
add, although he promised to let the man go, has
decided to hold him longer.”</p>

<p>“What for?” we both cried.</p>

<p>“Well,” came the slow reply, “the gardener says that
he was asked to go into Warren's library and take one
of those three caskets which I noticed on the stands.
He was to take the one nearest the safe; for doing this
he would receive one hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Who asked him to do that?” came Ranville's eager
question.</p>

<p>Bartley shrugged his shoulders in a gesture which
might express anything.</p>

<p>“He says your Chinese visitor was the one who made
the proposal.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch12">

<h2>Chapter XII. <br> The Chinaman Reappears</h2>

<p>We did not speak for a moment. Bartley's
statement had been so unexpected that I saw a rather
questioning look pass over Ranville's face. Though I had
been surprised to discover that the man who had
looked through the library window was the gardener,
yet I had not thought there was anything suspicious in
his action. His explanation, that he had seen the light
in the building and had gone to see who was within,
had sounded reasonable. The dull, stolid type of man
he was seemed to make it impossible there could be
any real motive in his trying to escape.</p>

<p>A look at both Bartley and Ranville told me they
had a different opinion. That the gardener had been
asked by the Chinaman who had visited us to take one
of the small caskets from the library was a rather
startling piece of information. Perhaps it was even
more—that bit of luck which Bartley said might lead
to the solving of the mystery. Just as I was about to
say this, Ranville spoke:</p>

<p>“Looks to me as though we had better run up to the
library again.”</p>

<p>Bartley nodded, and as we rose to go out into the
hall for our hats, all at once the door bell rang—a long,
shrill ring which died away, only to be repeated. With
a bound and a growl Trouble gave one leap, waking
from his sound sleep, and rushed to the hall. As I was
the closest to the front door, I went to open it,
wondering who it might be.</p>

<p>Pushing the growling dog behind me, I opened the
door to find a messenger boy standing there. With a
half grin he extended a telegram in my direction. I
signed the book, gave the boy a tip, and brought the
yellow envelope into the house. As I glanced at it, I
saw it was addressed to Carter.</p>

<p>Bartley took the telegram, and after a look at the
name said that he thought he had better open it. He
tore the thin paper, took out the message and slowly
read it through. As he glanced over the words, I saw
his eyebrows raise a little. Then he said, turning to us
both:</p>

<p>“Listen to this. It will interest you.”</p>

<blockquote class="letter">

  <p class="dateline">“Washington, D. C.</p>

  <p>“Know nothing of man you wired about under name
  given. No one that name ever connected with
  Embassy either here or London. Description given does
  not fit any one we have information about. Am wiring
  San Francisco and New York.</p>

  <p class="signature">“Wing.”</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As he finished reading it, he saw that Ranville was
not familiar with the name which was signed to the
telegram, so he said:</p>

<p>“This is the answer to the message you told me
Carter sent to his chief in Washington. Wing is the
head of the identification end of the Secret Service.
From what he says you can see they do not know your
Chinese friend.”</p>

<p>Ranville's face clouded for a moment. He informed
us he had been of the opinion that the oriental had
told us the truth. He added, there was only one
explanation of his visit that now seemed reasonable. As
we both waited for him to tell us what he thought, he
continued:</p>

<p>“Our Chinese gentleman must have come here more
to see if we had any suspicions of him than anything
else. He had his nerve at that. He must have known
Carter is with the secret service, and that I am in the
same line myself. He was fishing for information.”</p>

<p>Bartley nodded, agreeing:</p>

<p>“You are right. But at the same time I have an
idea that he came for another reason also. It was
information he wanted, but information of another type,
perhaps.”</p>

<p>As we both looked at him in surprise, he went on:</p>

<p>“There seems little doubt the story he told you
regarding having an appointment with Mr. Warren and
about the ashes of Buddha were lies. But I am half
believing he did tell you the truth when he said he
found Mr. Warren dead. What he came to see you
about was something else. He knew that his
appearance would be spoken about. What he wanted to
discover from you was if you had found out the real
object of his visit to the library. And that means—”</p>

<p>“And that means,” broke in Ranville, “the quicker
we get over to the library and take a look at that box
the better.”</p>

<p>Bartley agreed to this and, asking me to get the car,
started up the stairs to his room saying there were
several small things he wished to take with him. By the
time I had driven the car from the garage to the side
of the house Bartley and Ranville were ready and
jumped in by my side.</p>

<p>We said nothing on our ride. It was after twelve,
a warm summer evening with just enough moon to
make the driving good. I drove at a rather high speed,
for the streets were empty, and only a few lights were
to be seen at the windows of the houses we passed. By
the high wall which ran around the Warren grounds I
parked the car, and we climbed out.</p>

<p>The tall iron gate was closed, though not locked.
As we came up the path, the dark mass of the house
loomed up before us, silent and without a light. The
path through the trees had a silver streak of
moonlight running down its center. When we came to the
hill upon which stood the eight-sided library, I was
surprised to find that the building was dark. I
whispered to Bartley that I thought the chief had said he
had left a policeman on guard, only to have Bartley
answer that the chief had decided it was no longer
necessary.</p>

<p>The door of the library was locked, but Bartley
produced from his pocket a little steel instrument, and
with the ray from the flashlight on the lock quickly
opened it. We slid into the dark room, closing the door
behind us. Bartley turned on the light, and we gave
one hurried look around the room.</p>

<p>I had noticed on my other visits to the library the
small tables upon which had stood three boxes. They
were not the ordinary type of a box, but very highly
finished, with carvings of dragons and odd animals all
over their sides. The wood of each of them was
stained dark with age until they were almost black in
color. I had noticed these three boxes as they stood on
the three tables, but I had not been interested in them,
chiefly because of the fact that I had been unable to
lift the covers.</p>

<p>All three of the tables, which after all were more
stands than anything else, were on the side of the desk
nearest the door. Two of them were over to the
extreme left, near the bookcases, the other was more in
the center near the safe. It was to this one Bartley
hastened, it being the one the chief had mentioned over
the phone. For several moments we stood looking
down at it.</p>

<p>The box was dingy with the years—a box three feet
at least in length and several feet high. The edges
were weird dragons, the tails at the corners making the
little rests upon which the casket stood. Bartley
reached out his hand and tried to open the massive
gold lock, but without success. The casket was
securely locked. He stood looking at it for a moment,
then picked it up in his two hands. I could tell by the
look he gave us that it was heavy. He placed it again
on the stand, and then glanced around the room.</p>

<p>As his eyes fell upon the other two caskets, he
crossed the room to look at them, we following. It
needed but a glance to see that they were alike in every
particular—made of the same kind of wood, with the
identical dragons on each corner; and like the first one
we had noticed, they were also locked. After he had
lifted each one he turned to us.</p>

<p>“I think we had better make an effort to open that
box. In a sense we have no right to do so; but I have
a keen desire to know what is inside.”</p>

<p>When we returned to the first casket, he found it was
not as easy to open as perhaps he had thought. The
steel instrument which he used—a thing which would
open almost any lock—in the end did its work, but not
until the lock had been wrenched away, and a portion
of the woodwork broken. Then as he threw up the
lid, we came closer to see what was within.</p>

<p>There was no inner cover to the box, for the wood
was very thick and another was not needed. At first
glance there seemed to be nothing of value. The top
was covered with yellow sheets of straw paper, thick
heavy paper, which rustled as Bartley lifted them up.
And then as he threw the last piece of paper away, he
bent over the box and gave a little exclamation.</p>

<p>There seemed at first nothing to become excited
over. Only a row of small tins, placed in an orderly
line and packed closely together, met my eye—small
tins, not very heavy nor large. But as Bartley pulled
one from the interior of the box, his eyes met Ranville's
and the two men nodded at the same second. Then
with the bit of steel he pried off the top of the tin,
gazed for a moment at its contents, and then raised it
to his nose. One smell, and he passed the tin to me.</p>

<p>It was a small tin of very little weight. Its interior
was filled with a dark, thick mass, the color of dark
molasses. It did not need his words to tell me what
he had found. The casket before us was filled with
similar tins, and I knew that each one of them
contained, as did the one I held in my hand, opium.</p>

<p>Just what we had expected to discover in the casket
would have been hard to have said. One thing was
true, three very surprised men stood looking silently
at the rows of small tins within the box. Though there
were not so very many, yet it seemed to be the purest
kind of opium; and that meant they were worth a good
deal of money. And then Ranville gave a long low
whistle and turned to Bartley:</p>

<p>“A bit odd this. Never expected to find anything
like it when we came here.”</p>

<p>Bartley shook his head, his eyes gravely studying
the rows of tins. Then he went over to the two other
stands and returned to the great desk with the two
caskets under his arms. Without a word he started to
pick the locks of these, and after the same difficulty
which he had with the first one opened them. When
they were opened, there was another surprise for us.
These two boxes were empty; they contained nothing,
not even a piece of rice paper.</p>

<p>Ranville, after a little start of surprise, seated
himself in a chair by the desk and very carefully began
to examine the three boxes. To me they seemed just
alike—made from the same dark heavy wood with the
similar carvings. But he turned them on one end and
then another, looking them all over. On the first one,
the one in which he had found the opium, he spent the
slightest time. Then as though satisfied, he pushed
back his chair and rose to his feet. For a moment he
stood looking gravely at the three caskets upon the desk,
then he said:</p>

<p>“That first box has a little mark on it that the others
do not have.”</p>

<p>He picked it up and showed us a narrow line which
ran across the feet of two of the dragons. The dragons'
tails made the legs upon which the casket stood, and all
three boxes were similar—similar save for the one
respect; as he pointed out to us, the first box we had
opened—the one containing the opium—had the line
etched deeply across two of the dragons' legs, the other
boxes did not have a mark.</p>

<p>He pointed it out to us, and Bartley shot a
questioning look at his face and then slowly nodded. Their
eyes met, and Ranville after another glance at the
three boxes explained:</p>

<p>“I don't know much about this chap Warren, but I
am a bit sure that there is one thing we can agree upon.
It is: he never knew what was in that casket.”</p>

<p>“Then why did he have it in his library?” I shot
out.</p>

<p>“That is what we do not know,” came the reply.
“But it is absurd to think that a man of his wealth and
his position would be engaged in smuggling opium.”</p>

<p>The Englishman paused as if satisfied by what he
had said, and Bartley added:</p>

<p>“And you can be rather sure of another thing,
Ranville, Warren would not have placed that box in such a
prominent position if he had any idea what was in it.
For that matter, why were the other two boxes empty?
You have only to look at the locks to see it is very much
to be doubted if a key has ever been used on any of
them.”</p>

<p>“But the Chinaman knew what was in the casket,” I
ventured.</p>

<p>“Of course, he did,” Bartley commented. “And that
is as mysterious as the finding of the opium. He not
only knew, but also knew there was nothing in the other
boxes.”</p>

<p>The two men debated for a while as to just what they
had better do. Ranville was of the opinion it might be
well to call the chief and tell what had been found.
But Bartley remarked that the chief would be in bed,
and added that he would not be the man to throw any
light upon the affair. To this Ranville agreed, though
he did suggest that the chief might be able to discover
from the gardener the time and place he was to have
met the Chinaman.</p>

<p>In the end they decided to take the box which
contained the opium back to Carter's and to say nothing
about it until we had seen Niles Patton. Patton was
to arrive in the morning to set to work upon his task
of completing Warren's book. As he had been his
assistant in China, he might know something regarding
the boxes. Bartley insisted that we would discover
they had just been brought by Warren on his return
from his last expedition.</p>

<p>Bartley took the box under his arm, and we left the
library, first putting out the lights. Though he had
opened the door by picking the lock, yet he had not
damaged it, and we were able to lock it. Silently we
went down the path between the two hedges—a path
now dark as the moon had set.</p>

<p>When we reached the house, I placed the car in the
garage, leaving the dog to keep it company. Bartley
and Ranville had left me at the drive, and when I came
out of the garage, I saw they had turned on the lights
in the living room. Through the wide glass window
I could see Bartley as he placed the casket on the
living room table.</p>

<p>I stood for a moment outside the garage. It was
very still. Far away the whistle of a train rose and
fell before it died away. Then save for the low
murmur of the water on the shore there was not a sound.
It was also dark; the moon had disappeared, and the
few stars were hidden by low-hanging clouds. Through
the dark shadows cast by the trees I could catch a
glimpse of the street lights, but save for those the yard
was a dense shadow.</p>

<p>For a while I stood by the edge of the lawn, though
just why I did not go to the house would have been
hard to say. The slight breeze from the lake felt cool,
and something about the darkness and the silence
appealed to me. And then, just as I was about to go up
the path, there came a sound; it was not a loud noise.
Perhaps if I had not been turned in the direction of
the lake at that moment, I would not have heard it.
My ears had caught the sound of the click of an oar
out on the lake.</p>

<p>Rather surprised, for it was almost one o'clock, I
went around the side of the garage and stopped by the
water's edge. Peering out across the lake, I tried to
discover the boat from which the sound had come. But
the darkness was too dense, and I could see but a few
feet from the shore. Then, as I listened, once again
there came the click of the oar against the oarlock.
Far out on the lake some one was rowing a boat.</p>

<p>It seemed rather a curious thing that any one should
be out on the lake at this time of the night. Just where
they were I could not tell, for the darkness could not
be pierced, and the boat was carrying no light. But
as I caught the sound of the oars, I judged they must
be directly opposite me. And then as I listened, the
sound died away, and though I waited for some
minutes longer, I did not hear it again.</p>

<p>When I entered the living room, Bartley commented
on the length of time it had taken me to put up the
car. I told him of the boat I had heard, but he made
no reply. Perhaps he might have said something if
Ranville had not come into the room bearing three
glasses for what he called a bedtime drink. With the
sober air men have when they go through the sacred
rite of a drink, we swallowed our Scotch and decided
that it was time to go to bed.</p>

<p>Ranville locked the front door, put down the
windows, and we went up the wide stairs to our sleeping
rooms. Bartley and I had adjoining bedrooms, and
while I was undressing I wandered back and forth
between the two. Then as Bartley put out his light, I
went back into my room and at length climbed into
bed.</p>

<p>I should have been sleepy, but as the moments went
by sleep became the last thing I desired. I tossed
back and forth on the bed becoming more wide awake
every moment. In sheer disgust I tried various things
which are said to bring sleep. I counted to several
hundred then closed my eyes and tried to see the sheep
jumping the fence. But as I saw no sheep, the effort
was not a success. At last in sheer disgust I rolled over
on my back and lay staring in the darkness.</p>

<p>It was very still. From a distance came the weird
hoot of an owl. Once a car went past in the road
before the house. Then far away I heard a clock in the
village strike two. But sleep would not come. Then
as there fell an utter silence, I reached the point where
every nerve was straining, hoping for a sound. Very
suddenly the sound came—causing me to sit upright in
my bed.</p>

<p>It was not a sound which came floating in from the
open windows. Instead, it came from the house—from
below my room; a sound which lasted but a few
seconds, then died away, and silence fell again. But when
I heard it, I knew no noise of that kind should have
disturbed me, for from below I had heard the crash
of a chair—a chair falling to the floor.</p>

<p>Sitting tense and upright in the bed, I listened for
a moment. There came no other noise—only the soft
rustling of the trees outside my window. Slipping out
of bed, I went softly across the floor and into Bartley's
room. By the side of his bed I paused. I could hear
his low breathing as I gently shook his arm to waken
him. In a moment he stirred, and when I knew he was
awake, I told him what I had heard. The next second
he was out of bed.</p>

<p>The room was very dark, and I could not see him.
But I heard him go to his table and open a drawer.
Then he came back to my side and whispered:</p>

<p>“We will get Ranville. As we have to go out in the
hall, make no sound.”</p>

<p>The hall was very wide, and the stairs came up in a
wide sweep from the first floor. Our rooms were about
half-way down the hallway, with Ranville's at the
extreme end. Bartley opened the door so silently that I
did not hear a sound; then with our hands on the wall
we crept slowly down the hall. We found Ranville's
door slightly ajar, and after we slipped into the room
Bartley gently closed it.</p>

<p>Ranville was sleeping very soundly, and Bartley had
to shake him many times before he roused him. He
woke slowly, saying something in a very sleepy voice.
Then as he became wide awake, his tone became crisp
as he wanted to know what was the matter. In a few
words Bartley told him how I had heard a chair fall
over in the living room. And then through the
darkness came the eager whisper of the Englishman.</p>

<p>“Where did you put that box of opium?”</p>

<p>I heard a low chuckle from Bartley as he whispered
back that it was well hidden in his own room. Then
as Ranville slid out of bed, he asked what we should
do. Bartley's answer was quick and low:</p>

<p>“Of course, there must have been some one down
stairs when the chair crashed. That is, unless Pelt
was dreaming. Now you know professional thieves
leave the door open for a fast getaway. I am going
to slide out of your window, Ranville, along the roof
of the veranda. You and Pelt can go downstairs, first
giving me a moment's start. I want to be by the front
door. When you get to the living room, try and turn
on the lights. Take your gun and your flashlight.”</p>

<p>Ranville went to his bureau, fumbled a moment in
the dark, and came back to our side. He said in a low
voice that he had his gun and the light. Then Bartley
went over by the window. We could not see him very
clearly, only as a darker shadow against the blackness.
But we heard him as he took the screen out, and there
came a soft scraping sound as he went out on the roof.
As this died away, Ranville whispered:</p>

<p>“Come on, Pelt,” and started for the door.</p>

<p>Out in the hall we paused a moment to listen, but
no sound came to our ears. With my hand against the
wall I crept softly down its length until we came to
the rail of the stairs which led to the first floor. Again
we paused, but heard nothing. Then very carefully,
one step at a time, we went down the stairs, pausing at
each step to listen. We reached the bottom of the
stairs without hearing anything.</p>

<p>The hall was very wide. On the right was the great
living room, which ran the entire length of the house.
On the left was a dining room and a small library. The
living room was directly under the room in which I
slept, and the sound of the falling chair had come from
there. There was a wide double door, and I knew that
the doors were open. But when, after going very
carefully down the hall, we reached the doorway, we
discovered as we put out our hands that it was closed.</p>

<p>This rather startled me for a second though I knew
they could not be locked; there was no kind of a lock
on the door. Whoever had entered the room had
closed the doors, no doubt to prevent any sound being
heard. I felt Ranville's hand as it went searching over
the surface of the door and as it slid over my fingers.
Then slowly I felt the door open as he pushed against
it—open until we were able to slip into the room.</p>

<p>As we paused inside the door for a second, we saw
and heard nothing. Then at the extreme end of the
room in the place where Carter had a large cabinet,
we saw the flicker of a flashlight—saw it for a moment
as it swept over the surface of the cabinet then it
suddenly died away. Some one was in the room directly
across from us.</p>

<p>With a pressure upon my arm Ranville started
around the wall to the right; I realized he wished to get
to the windows to prevent any chance of escape. With
but a second's hesitancy I went around to the left.
Carefully and very slowly, with one hand on the wall,
I crept along. I had no gun, no flashlight, and every
second I was regretting it. I could hear the figure by
the cabinet as it fumbled at the glass door, but that
was all.</p>

<p>And then I paused stiffening to attention. Again
there came the circle of light as it played over the
cabinet. And then as if roused by some sound it
began to sweep across the room. I watched the round
circle of light as it swept over chairs and tables,
creeping closer and closer to the windows. Then, as for the
barest second I saw it flash over Ranville's feet, there
came his voice:</p>

<p>“Put up your hands or I shoot!” And as the light
clicked off, I heard the sound of running feet, and there
came the sharp echo of Ranville's gun.</p>

<p>The sound of the gun in the small room was
deafening. For a moment after it died away I could hear
nothing else. But in that moment Ranville must have
leaped for the lights and found them, for the next
instant the room was a blaze of brightness, so much so
that for a while I could barely see. When I was able
to look around the room, it was only to see Ranville's
eager face as his eyes swept every bit of furniture.
Save for myself and the Englishman the room was
empty.</p>

<p>As we turned to glance at each other, there came the
sharp bang of the front door. All at once Trouble
out in the garage began to bark—deep, sinister barks,
which became louder every second. Our eyes met, and
then we rushed out into the hall, down its length and
out to the door. Reaching it first I flung it wide and
stumbled out onto the veranda. As I reached it I
heard the sound of two men—two men struggling on
the grass below.</p>

<p>I ran back into the hall as Ranville hurried down the
veranda steps. I was searching for the button of the
porch light, and it seemed as if I could never find it.
But find it I did, gave it one push, and the next instant
the veranda was as light as day. Running out to the
top of the steps I was just in time to see Bartley
coming up their length—coming slowly and not alone.</p>

<p>His pajamas were stained by the dirt and the grass.
In one hand was his revolver which was shoved against
the back of the man who walked in front of him—a
man who walked slowly and reluctantly, a man whose
face I could not see. He was a tall man whose hands
were hidden by his side and who wore a dark suit.
For a moment I wondered who it might be. Then there
began to come a dawning recognition.</p>

<p>Up the steps they came, and Bartley's face was very
set. At the top step the man hesitated, only to have
Bartley utter a sharp command and push against his
back with the revolver. Then as they reached my side,
the man lifted his head and looked at me. With one
glance I recognized him. There before me, his yellow
face calm as if he had just come from a pleasure trip,
yet with his dark eyes flashing, was the gentleman who
had visited us a while before. The Chinaman stood
before us.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch13">

<h2>Chapter XIII. <br> We Hear a Story—and—Discover It Is True</h2>

<p>No one spoke for a moment. Perhaps we were all
too surprised to say anything. The calmest one of all
was the oriental. His black suit was rumpled and
covered with dirt from the path, but his face was calm and
impassive. Only the narrow eyes gave any hint of
feeling, and the glare in them was not a pleasant one.
Then as with a short command Bartley pushed the
gun closer against the man's back, we went into the
house, down the hall, and into the living room.</p>

<p>As we dropped into chairs, Bartley motioned to his
prisoner to be seated. With a slight shrug of his
shoulders the Chinaman sank into his seat. Never
taking his eyes off him, Bartley walked over to the
chair near the table, directly opposite. As he seated
himself, the revolver in his lap, the two men eyed each
other in a long questioning gaze. There seemed more
curiosity in the almond-shaped eyes than fear.</p>

<p>With a little gesture, the Chinaman murmured:</p>

<p>“If it had not been for a chair—”</p>

<p>There came no reply from Bartley. Ranville was
studying the oriental with a deliberateness which took
in every feature, as though he was trying to remember
if he had ever seen him in London. And then all at
once the man spoke again. His voice was cool and
low as if he were making a social call.</p>

<p>“You know I told you before that I know nothing
about the murder of Mr. Warren.”</p>

<p>Bartley shot out but one word, “Maybe.”</p>

<p>Again the eyes of the two men met and for a
moment their glances held. Then the Chinaman dropped
his eyes to his hands. The long fingers folded and
unfolded as though he were playing some game. After
a silence he spoke again:</p>

<p>“May I ask what you plan to do with me?”</p>

<p>“That depends,” was Bartley's slow response.</p>

<p>I saw a sudden gleam of interest come into the yellow
face, and then it became as impassive as before. One
thing was certain: there was not a trace of fear in his
manner though it seemed to me he was rather curious
as to who Bartley might be. Again he looked at him,
and then ventured:</p>

<p>“What is it you wish me to tell you?”</p>

<p>Bartley's voice was very impersonal as he replied:</p>

<p>“I am not sure I wish you to tell me anything; but
if you do wish to speak, you might explain how that
box of opium got into Warren's possession.”</p>

<p>It was not a smile that passed over the Chinaman's
face, though his features did move a little. For a
moment he let his head sink back against his chair and
his eyes partly closed as if he was thinking. Then
suddenly he sat upright and said:</p>

<p>“I am perfectly willing to tell you that. It is really
very simple. Mr. Warren was given six boxes by a
certain gentleman he met in China. They were rare
and old; three were for himself; the other three he was
asked to bring as a gift from this man to a friend of his
in America.”</p>

<p>He paused as if reflecting and as he did not speak
for a moment, Bartley suggested:</p>

<p>“And three of them contained opium.”</p>

<p>The Chinaman made a slight bow.</p>

<p>“Your wisdom is indeed great,” was the reply.
“Three of them did. When they were given Mr.
Warren, just as he was about to sail for America, he was
told that the keys of the boxes were lost. But he was
told they would be sent, and should reach him before
he unpacked his goods. As they were all coming in
duty free because of his scientific standing this man
knew that the boxes would not be opened. So
marking the three which contained opium, he simply used
the scientist as the carrying agent.”</p>

<p>Again he paused, and we could tell that he did not
care to say anything more. The story seemed logical.
In the hurry and confusion of Warren's departure from
China, the six boxes would not be examined very
carefully. The story of the lost keys would seem so
reasonable that there was not much of a chance Warren
would open the boxes. His baggage would come in
without examination. I could well understand how the
plan to send opium in the three boxes would work. But
there was something else; one of the boxes must have
gone astray. And as if reading my thoughts Bartley
said: “And I presume that through some accident Mr.
Warren in delivering the three boxes made a
mistake—sent one of the three which was given to him.”</p>

<p>The Chinaman simply nodded, and the thin lips shut
as if he had made up his mind to talk no more. There
were a number of other things we wished to know.
Who was the man who had received the three boxes
from Warren? And above all who was this Chinaman
before us? But though Bartley did his best to have the
man answer these questions, he had no success. To
them all there came but a bland smile and silence.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the house a clock struck three, and as
if realizing the hour, Bartley motioned to me and said:</p>

<p>“Get the chief, Pelt. Have him come up here with
an officer and take this man away.”</p>

<p>The Chinaman gave a little start, but whatever he
might have felt was not shown in his face. For a
moment he studied his hands then raised his eyes and
said:</p>

<p>“But after all I have done nothing for which I can
be given to the police.”</p>

<p>“Breaking and entering. Attempted burglary.
Possession of a dangerous weapon,” checked off Bartley's
cool voice.</p>

<p>“So,” was the only comment.</p>

<p>I went out into the hall to the telephone. There was
some little difficulty in getting the chief. When he did
come to the phone, it was a very sleepy voice which
said: “Hello.” I knew that I had dragged him out of
bed. For a moment his voice showed that he did not
understand what I was telling him. Then all at once
the tone of sleepiness vanished, and he promised to
come out as soon as possible.</p>

<p>When I returned to the living room, it was to find
that the situation had not changed. In the chair still
sat the Chinaman, his entire figure showing boredom.
Across from him was Bartley, the gun in his lap, and his
eyes never leaving the man across from him. Just after
I had sank down into my chair, the Chinaman asked
if he could smoke. As Bartley assented, Ranville took
a cigarette from his case and took it over to him,
striking the match for him to get his light.</p>

<p>The man leaned back in his chair as coolly as if he
was sitting in some club. Through his narrow
half-shut eyes he watched the smoke as it curled to the
ceiling. But speak he did not, and the glances which he
gave us all in turn were very impersonal. Though he
knew what we were waiting for yet he showed no
anxiety or, for that matter, not the slightest sign of
interest.</p>

<p>At length, just when I was beginning to wonder if
they would ever come, there was the sound of a car—a
car which came up the drive. In a bored manner
Ranville rose to his feet and went out into the hall. He
returned in a second with the chief followed by one
of the village policemen. The chief's hair was
unbrushed and he was wearing no hat. It needed but a
glance to tell that his being roused from a sound sleep
had not improved his disposition.</p>

<p>He came into the room with the heavy swaying walk
he had, but paused when he had his first glimpse of the
Chinaman sitting in the chair. After a few words with
Bartley he went over to the oriental and touched him
on the shoulder. At the touch the Chinaman
muttered something in Chinese. His eyes flared but
without protest he rose and, obeying the chief's gesture,
started to the door.</p>

<p>With a word to his policeman the chief turned to
Bartley. He was informed I had given him all the
information he needed. The Chinaman had been caught
in the house and a charge of attempted burglary could
stand on the docket. But he very strongly urged the
chief to keep a careful eye on the man until he had
him in jail. To this the chief grunted some reply and
with revolver in hand started for the door. Reaching
it he gave the Chinaman a command, and they went
out with him between the chief and his policeman.</p>

<p>As the sound of their car died away Ranville turned
to Bartley:</p>

<p>“Wager you a couple of pounds if they are not
careful that chap never reaches the police station. He is
a pretty cold proposition.”</p>

<p>Bartley agreed to this, and then I asked him if he
believed the story the man had told. He was silent for a
while as if running it over in his mind then replied:</p>

<p>“I think in the main he probably told the truth.
Don't you, Ranville?”</p>

<p>Ranville admitted he thought that was so. Within
certain limits the man had told the truth but not all the
truth. He said that he thought his explanation as to
why Warren had in his possession a box containing
opium was the truth. And he agreed also that unless
one wished to think the scientist was engaged in
smuggling the stuff there could be no other reasonable
explanation. But there were a few other things he
wanted to know. First, did the Chinaman know
anything about the murder? Was his story of finding the
door of the library open, and then walking in and
discovering Warren dead, true? If it was, he could see
nothing unreasonable in the fact the man never
notified the authorities that he had found a murdered man.
He might be held under suspicion himself and to a
Chinese mind the murder anyway was none of his
affair. It was because of this, because also he had told
us the story of the discovery of the body, that he had
an idea the man knew nothing about the murder itself.
That was his idea but after all he was not sure.</p>

<p>It was at this point I broke into his rather
disconnected monologue to say:</p>

<p>“I don't think the Chinaman would ever have cut
that cross in Warren's forehead.”</p>

<p>There came one astonished look from Bartley, and
he burst out:</p>

<p>“What cross? What under heavens are you talking
about?”</p>

<p>It had never dawned upon me Bartley did not know
about the two faint lines which had been scratched into
the dead man's forehead. And then I remembered
he had read only the newspaper accounts and they had
not mentioned the cross. The coroner even had not
brought it to the attention of the jury. So I told him
what I had found. For some reason it seemed to
interest him even more than I had expected. He asked a
hundred questions, and in the end became very
thoughtful. At last he turned to Ranville:</p>

<p>“You're right,” he said. “The Chinaman never killed
Warren. No man of that race I have ever known has
marked his victim after death in such a manner. They
will torture their victims sometimes with fiendish
cruelty. They will put them to death in the most
devilish and grewsome fashions, but they do not mark
them in that way. You are right I guess, Ranville. It
was not a crime committed by any Chinaman. It
might have been a crime committed by another type of
person. The sort that—”</p>

<p>Suddenly the telephone broke in on him with a long
shrill ring, stopped for a second and then rang again.
With a little look of astonishment Bartley rose from
his chair and went out to answer it. We heard his
voice as he talked but could not distinguish the words.
When he returned to the room, there was a little grin
on his face as he turned to Ranville.</p>

<p>“You are right once more.”</p>

<p>The Englishman's eyebrows lifted, and Bartley half
laughed.</p>

<p>“The chief just called. The Chinaman got away
from them. They reached the station all right but in
some manner I don't just understand how it was, he
managed to slip out of their grasp. He just asked me
what to do.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, listening to the clock which
was now striking four; then he yawned and said:</p>

<p>“I told the chief the best thing to do was to go home
and go to bed. He won't find that man to-night. I
doubt if he ever finds him. And what's more, I am
going myself to take the advice I gave.”</p>

<p>He started for the hall, and as Ranville rose, I
followed his example. We locked the door and went
rather wearily up the stairs. Ranville yawned a good
night at our door, and a moment later I was in my bed.
It had not only been an exciting night, but also a very
perplexing one. For a while I tried to puzzle out the
happenings of the evening. Then realizing how tired
I was, I turned over and went to sleep.</p>

<p>It was the sun streaming through the open window
which awakened me the next morning. For a while I
lay thinking over the events of the night before. Then
the sound of people in the room below came faintly to
my ears. Rising, I took a quick shower and went
down to the dining room. To my surprise, the first
person I saw when I reached the door was Carter.
Across the table from Bartley he was laughing at
something that had been said.</p>

<p>He greeted me with a slap on the back, and then
introduced the young man by his side—a heavy-set young
man, with darkish hair, whose smile was very pleasing
as he rose to answer to the name of Niles Patton. As
I slipped into my seat at the breakfast table, Carter
informed me he had come up on the night train, and
that he had been lucky in finding that Patton was on
the same train.</p>

<p>For a while the conversation played around many
topics—a conversation in which Patton took an active
part. He seemed a very likable sort of man, boyish in
both looks and mannerisms. He told us that he judged
it would not take him so very long to go over Warren's
notes, and then began to tell us stories regarding their
experience in China. Long before he had finished we
had adjourned to the veranda.</p>

<p>When there came a lull in the conversation Ranville
turned to Carter and drawled:</p>

<p>“Did you know that the house was broken into last
night?”</p>

<p>Carter gave him an amazed look, and in a few words
he was informed of what had taken place. Then
Ranville went on to tell him of our discovery of a box of
opium in Warren's library—a statement which caused
Patton to give a sudden start of surprise. With a
laugh the Englishman went on to tell of the story the
Chinaman had told us regarding these boxes which he
claimed were given to Warren.</p>

<p>“Did you know anything of six boxes which were
given to Warren just before you sailed to America?”
was the question Bartley asked Patton.</p>

<p>The young man turned in his chair and nodded.</p>

<p>“Just a little. There were six boxes, about three
feet long, as I remember. Some one gave them to
Warren, though who it was I do not know. I know they
came along just as we were about to sail and I had to
find a place for them in our baggage. Mr. Warren
said they were rare examples of Chinese woodwork
and seemed pleased to get them. But who gave them
to him I have not the slightest idea.”</p>

<p>“There were six of them,” commented Ranville.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” came Patton's reply. “Six, all alike.
Three of them were being brought by Mr. Warren to
some one in Washington. But he never told me who
it was.”</p>

<p>Carter, who had been listening carefully, gave a little
laugh as he made his contribution to the subject.</p>

<p>“There is always some new plan being used to get
opium into the country. The Revenue men tell me
they have their troubles. But this was not so bad.
Warren, of course, would bring in all of his goods
without having to go through the customs. We do that
always with big explorers. Those three boxes to the
unknown man could have contained a good many
thousands of dollars' worth of the drug. Only it seems there
was a mistake, and they received one box which should
have remained with Warren.”</p>

<p>“You are sure there is no way you can discover to
whom Warren was to give those boxes, Patton?” was
Bartley's question.</p>

<p>The young man shook his head.</p>

<p>“None that I know of now. Mr. Warren must have
done it himself. They went down to Washington with
him I know that. But what he did with them I have
not the slightest idea.”</p>

<p>We must have talked for over an hour, for it was
around ten when Patton gave a look at his watch and,
rising hurriedly, said he had better be getting over to
Warren's library. He added that he would spend the
day in finding out just what had been done on the book,
and asked the telephone address of the girl who had
acted as the secretary. As he rose, Carter got up with
him and said he would drive him over, first reminding
him that we expected him at dinner around seven.</p>

<p>The two men had gone down the steps and were by
the garage door when Bartley suddenly rose and,
calling to Patton, went down on the lawn to his side. For
a few moments the two men talked and I could tell
from Bartley's manner that he was very serious. Then
I saw Patton slowly nod his head, heard him say,
“Yes,” and the next moment he climbed into the car,
which Carter had run out of the garage. As they drove
out of the yard, Bartley stood watching them and after
they had turned into the road he came slowly up the
steps. His face was grave and at the same time rather
troubled. As I started to ask him what was the
matter his expression changed. He turned to Ranville
and myself and said:</p>

<p>“Well, what about a little golf?”</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch14">

<h2>Chapter XIV. <br> Patton Telephones—“It's Murder”</h2>

<p>Ranville, at the invitation to play golf, informed
us very earnestly that he did not care for the game.
So, leaving him with his nose buried deep in a
magazine, we went out to the car. The morning was cool,
with a breeze sweeping across the lake from the distant
hills. Forty-five minutes later we drove up the
sweeping road which led to the club house.</p>

<p>As we waited our turn to drive off from the first tee,
I sank on the bench and studied the view before me.
The club house was on a small elevation, and one could
take in the countryside for miles around. The lake
lay several miles away, its surface dark blue. Six miles
in front of us we could see the church steeples in the
town as they peered through the leaves of the trees.
Across the lake the mountains stood forth etched into
sharp lines by the clear air.</p>

<p>Golf was a game Bartley loved but one which,
strange to say, he failed to play very well. Sometimes
his game would be wonderful, at other times directly
opposite. He started out with his first drive by one of
the worst slices I have ever seen—one which took his
ball off the fairway, across the rough and on to the
fairway of another hole. When he sank the ball into
the first hole with his eighth shot, he turned to give
me a little grin.</p>

<p>By the time we had reached the fifth hole, his score
was approaching forty. I had seen him play some
rather poor golf, but never such a game as he was
playing to-day. When the ball had dropped into the sixth
hole, he motioned to me and walked over to a clump
of trees by the side of the course. As he flung himself
down upon the ground, I followed his example,
wondering why he had interrupted his game. He took a
cigarette from a case, which he passed to me, lighted it,
and then said:</p>

<p>“I have been wondering, Pelt, if you told me
everything that you observed that night you found Warren
dead in his library. From what Ranville and the chief
tell me, there have been no clews of any sort. Not a
thing which would point to any particular person as the
murderer. In a sense that is unusual. And as I have
run this thing over in my mind, I have been
wondering—wondering if there is anything which you did not
tell me.”</p>

<p>I assured him that he must know, either from what
I had told him or Ranville, everything that was of
importance. But he shook his head as if he did not agree.
He suggested I start in at the beginning and tell him
the story as if he was hearing it for the first time.
And so, carefully picking my words, I started to tell
him of everything we had seen from the time we left the
house until after we had found the body. When I
came to the place where I said the body lay in a queer
position on the floor he stopped me.</p>

<p>“There is something new, Pelt. What do you mean
by a queer position?”</p>

<p>“Why, the arms were extended from the body,” was
my reply.</p>

<p>He gave me one look, and then drew a figure with
the end of his golf stick—a figure upon the grass in
the shape of a cross.</p>

<p>“Like that?” he asked.</p>

<p>I nodded, and as he said nothing, added I had told
Carter it seemed impossible for a man to fall in such
a position. For a moment I saw his face become very
thoughtful, and then he said:</p>

<p>“You are right about that, Pelt. He was struck by
a dagger—struck suddenly through the heart. When
he fell from his chair to the floor, the odds were a
thousand to one against his falling in that position.”</p>

<p>Across the green a squirrel dashed down a tree, ran
across the grass and scampered up another tree.
Bartley watched it with a very peculiar expression on his
face. Then he turned to me:</p>

<p>“As I understand it, Pelt, the Chinaman was at the
library just before six o'clock. He says the door was
open, and that he found Warren dead. Let us believe
the story. The housekeeper was at the library
sometime between six and seven. She found the door
locked; what is more, she claimed she thought she
heard some one in the building. That may not be so;
her fear and nervousness might have suggested it.”</p>

<p>All at once I remembered the gardener had testified
at the inquest that as he came from his work after six
he saw a boat just rounding the point. I mentioned
this, reminding him that the point was below the
library. He thought this over for a while, then asked
what time it was the boy who had been picking berries
had seen the figure on the wall.</p>

<p>“Just before six,” I said. “He told me the whistle in
the town blew a moment after the man dropped on the
ground. He went down the other side of the wall.”</p>

<p>“He meant that the man went along the wall
outside of the Warren grounds?”</p>

<p>I nodded. Very slowly he took a cigar and lighted
it, blowing the first ring carefully. Then he said
thoughtfully:</p>

<p>“That may mean one thing.”</p>

<p>“What?” I asked.</p>

<p>“We may have to juggle the time limit a little,” he
commented. “But suppose we assume this—Warren
was killed before six; the murderer did leave the door
open. Perhaps it was because he saw the Chinaman
coming up the hill. If he did, he went out the back
door and returned when the oriental left. When he
climbed the wall, he threw the dagger into the swamp,
dropped on the ground and followed the wall down to
the shore. Here he had a boat, and as he was going
away, was seen by the gardener. In fact the gardener
must have been coming across the grounds, inside the
wall, when this person was going down to the shore,
outside.”</p>

<p>“But who closed the door of the library?” I
ventured.</p>

<p>“We do not know, of course. But we can make a
guess. It would be a very easy matter for this person
in the boat to watch the library from the lake. It
was on a hill and could be easily seen. Suppose he saw
the gardener. If so, he might return to the shore and
go back to the library. Why he went back, I cannot
understand. It must have been for some other
purpose than to close the doors; that was not necessary.
He knew that one person had discovered the murder;
but then again it is a very queer crime all the way
around.”</p>

<p>Though after this he asked me a number of other
questions, I could give him nothing which seemed of
any importance. For a while we talked, then rising
with the remark that he did not feel like playing golf
any longer, we walked across the course to the club
house. Here we had a drink of ginger ale and then,
going to the car, started for the house.</p>

<p>We discovered Ranville in the same position as when
we had left. Carter was not in sight, and we found
that he had not returned. As we dropped into easy
chairs, Ranville drawled out some question about our
game, then returned to his magazine. Finally, he flung
it aside and, after a glance around, turned to Bartley:</p>

<p>“Have you any ideas about this murder?”</p>

<p>“Have you?” was the retort.</p>

<p>The Englishman smiled as he shook his head, then
said:</p>

<p>“A few. Of course, what interests me is to watch
the apparent lack of interest the police are taking.
That, however, is no doubt due to the fact you have
no Central Police System as we do in England. I
should think you would be lost without it.”</p>

<p>“We are at times,” was the dry reply.</p>

<p>“Yes, so I would think,” commented Ranville. “You
see that's why this case interested me; I felt there were
no clews and such things. And I see that your local
police are not familiar with these technical crimes. So
I have been mulling it over. First, I thought about
the Chinaman, but the way the body had been marked
put him out, in my mind.”</p>

<p>He shot a look at Bartley, who nodded his
agreement; then went on:</p>

<p>“Of course, it would be silly to think the secretary
killed him. Then it dawned upon me that after all
the thing I perhaps could not understand was the
psychology of you Americans. Studying the whole
affair, I could not find a motive—” He paused, then
smiled, “At least a motive which would suit an
Englishman.”</p>

<p>Bartley shot him an admiring look, then laughed as
he replied:</p>

<p>“And in what you last said is, perhaps, the whole
solution of the crime. On the face of it there is no
apparent motive in sight. Warren had no enemies one
can think of. There seems no apparent reason for
killing him. And the whole thing is a matter of—well,
perhaps what you call the psychology of us Americans.”</p>

<p>I gave him a puzzled look, wondering what under
heavens he meant by his remark. But Ranville seemed
to find nothing out of the way in it, for he nodded in
a very wise manner. I was just on the verge of
asking Bartley what he meant when we heard Carter's
car drive into the yard. And when he came up the
steps, the first thing he asked was if lunch was ready.</p>

<p>It seemed to have turned warmer after lunch, and
we spent the early hours of the afternoon in just lying
around. Bartley buried himself in a book, while
Carter, after telling us very frankly that he was lazy,
went to sleep in the hammock. Ranville, who had some
letters he wished to write, vanished to his room, and
for several hours the piazza was silent. When at length
Bartley flung aside his book, it was to give a glance in
my direction and to ask if I cared to take a stroll.</p>

<p>We went rather leisurely out of the yard, turning up
the tree-lined sidewalk, and passed the little stone
church. I pointed it out to Bartley saying that it was
the church of the minister who had visited us. He gave
it a curious glance and remarked that the tower divided
the church from the rectory. Then he chuckled as
he assured me that the minister was, to say the least,
a fanatic.</p>

<p>We walked about a mile—until the pavement gave
place to a country road, and the summer estates to
farmhouses. Then we retraced our steps to the house.
For some reason, as we walked back, Bartley was very
silent. He seemed to be pondering over something, but
what it was I did not know as he gave no indication.
As once again we passed the green expanse of lawn
which led to the stone church, he stopped. I saw him
study the granite building with the ivy climbing over
the stones. Then to my surprise he said:</p>

<p>“What do you say if we pay the minister a visit?”</p>

<p>He did not wait for me to make any reply, but
started up the winding gravel path which led to the
rectory. I followed rather puzzled at his sudden
desire to call upon the clergyman. Ministers, as a rule,
were very much out of his line, and as we waited at
the rectory steps, I could not but wonder why he
wished to see him.</p>

<p>The door was at length opened by a woman. She
was a very old lady and extremely deaf. I judged by
her appearance that she must be the person who
looked after the house, for Carter had told us that he
was unmarried. To Bartley's inquiry if the minister
was in, she said he was not. I expected Bartley would
then turn to go, but instead he suggested that we
might wait in the study. She led us into a rather
ill-kept room. There were a great many books in the
bookcases along the wall, but they were dusty. In
fact, the whole room could have been much cleaner.
The desk was covered with newspapers, books and
pamphlets. Even the chairs were dusty. It needed but
a look at the room to understand the housekeeper did
not believe that cleanliness was next to Godliness.</p>

<p>The woman excused herself and went out leaving
us alone. For a moment Bartley's eyes went over the
row of books, and then he went closer to examine them.
From their appearance most of them had not been
taken from their places in many days. The dust lay
thick upon the dingy volumes—volumes which seemed
to be mostly theological works, and of a very orthodox
character. Of novels and works of science there was
not a trace. All the books along the wall dealt with
theology.</p>

<p>I watched Bartley pull one of the volumes from
the shelf and turn the pages. As his eyes fell upon
some sentence, he gave a shrug of his shoulders and
replaced the book. Walking over to the desk, he stood
for a moment glancing at the disordered contents.
Then he went over to the window and looked out.
When he turned, his eyes searched the room as if
looking for something, and at length came to rest on a
bookcase which was near the door.</p>

<p>It was an old-fashioned bookcase. One of those
affairs with glass doors with some kind of figured cloth
covering the glass within the case. Not a very large
case, and I doubted if there were more than four rows
of shelves. This case seemed to interest Bartley, for
he went across the floor, and in a moment knelt before
it to try the door. Not very much interested, I walked
to the window and for a few moments stood looking
out. When I turned, it was to discover that the
bookcase was open.</p>

<p>I did not bother to go closer to see what the books
might be. From where I stood I could see the
contents of the four shelves—shelves which were not all
filled. But those which were seemed to interest
Bartley very much. He pulled first one book and then
another forth, only to replace them and take another,
finding several over which he spent some time. Then
all at once he rose to his feet, closed the glass door,
and said we better be going.</p>

<p>Wondering a little why he had not waited until the
minister returned, I followed him out into the hall.
The woman was washing the windows by the front door,
and Bartley explained we were unable to wait any
longer. When we reached the open air, he struck
across the lawn to the hedge which divided Carter's
estate from the church. He said nothing, walking in
a hurried manner. And when we came through the
hedge and crossed the grass, he paused in front of the
house long enough to say that he was going to take
the car and go to town.</p>

<p>As he said nothing regarding my going with him, I
went into the house, to find Carter in his library. He
asked me where Bartley was, and I told him he was
going to town, hearing the sound of his car in the
drive as I spoke. Then, as Carter was engaged in
writing a letter, I picked up the paper and for a while
ran through its contents. There was little news,
however, and I soon threw it aside.</p>

<p>When Carter had finished his letter, he dropped into
a large chair, and we started to talk—a conversation
which was mostly one-sided. He told me Patton had
been very much pleased to find, when he reached the
library, that the young woman who had been Warren's
secretary was there. She had promised to work with
him, and, as she knew more about the library than
Patton did, her offer had taken quite a load off his
mind. Then he suddenly said that he thought he knew
why the Chinaman had not taken the box of opium
away when he discovered Warren murdered.</p>

<p>That had been one of the things which had puzzled
me, that is, if we were to accept the story the man had
told as being true. He had found the door of the
library open, and Warren dead. The box of opium was
his reason for being there; yet he had not taken it,
and it had been on the stand all the time. That had
rather puzzled me, and when Carter said he thought he
knew why it had been untouched, naturally I asked
his reason.</p>

<p>“Well,” he grinned, “it is what they call in the
mystery yarns ‘deduction.’ Now, of course, he must
have known there was a box in the library which
contained opium. He must have known that.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” came a voice from the doorway,
and Ranville came into the room and dropped into
the nearest chair.</p>

<p>“All right then,” retorted Carter seriously. “But if
he did not take it away with him, it was because he
did not know which one of the three boxes it was.”</p>

<p>“Not so good,” was Ranville's dry comment. He
threw one leg over his knee and added: “He might not
have been very sure when he went in. But I wager that
he knew before he went out.”</p>

<p>“What makes you say that?”</p>

<p>“It is very simple to me. He told the gardener to
bring him the box near the safe. That was the right
one as we discovered. If he did not take the box away,
there was a reason why he could not; some one must
have been approaching the library or else he did not
care to be seen with the large box under his arm.”</p>

<p>Carter at length agreed this might be so, and after
a while he went up to his room. Ranville and myself
talked a few moments, and then he went over to the
desk to write a letter. In my chair I dreamed away
the moments. The afternoon wore away, and in the
silence of the library I half dozed—dozed, to be
awakened by a muttered oath from Ranville. As I
gave a start, it was to see him looking at a piece of
paper in his hand. As his eyes met mine, he said, with
a rather sheepish expression on his face:</p>

<p>“What a confounded ass I have been!”</p>

<p>“What's the matter?” I drawled as I noticed his
eyes on the paper he held.</p>

<p>“Why, I forgot all about that bit of paper with the
letters; you know—those ‘Anani’ and that sort of
thing.”</p>

<p>I had found the paper by Warren's body. The
letters had puzzled us at the time, but we had paid
very little attention to them. Just what they meant,
I had not known nor any one else. But Ranville had
placed the paper in his pocket, and then apparently
forgotten all about it. Now, in reaching into his
pocket, he had found it; and the fact he had forgotten
all about it had put him in a decidedly bad humor.</p>

<p>I half laughed as I reminded him that we did not
suppress evidence in that manner in the States. He
gave me a rueful smile and again wondered what the
letters might mean. But I shook my head, saying I
had not the slightest idea. While we were arguing
about it, Bartley came into the room and asked what
we were talking about.</p>

<p>Extending the paper to him, Ranville told how I
had found it beside the body. He seemed chagrined
as he remarked that he had placed it in his pocket
and forgotten all about it. He added that I had said
it meant nothing anyway. With a look in my
direction, Bartley took the piece of paper, glanced at it,
spelled out the words, and suddenly chuckled. Then
he slowly spelt out the letters—“Anani—”</p>

<p>“So it means nothing, Pelt?” he asked.</p>

<p>I assured him that it meant nothing in my life.
Rising, I said that no word I knew anything about was
spelled like that. Again he looked at the paper, then
laughed, but the laughter lasted but a second, and his
face grew serious. He started to speak, checked
himself, and placed the paper in his bill case. Though
we asked him what he thought the letters meant, the
only reply we received was that he would tell us later.</p>

<p>It was almost six, and at Bartley's suggestion we
went to our rooms to be ready for dinner. Patton was
to eat with us, and I was eager to hear what he had
done during the day. Perhaps deep in my mind was
the wish he would inform us what the wonderful
discovery was that Warren had made in China.</p>

<p>After a quick shower I dressed and went down to
the piazza, where I was joined by the three men. For
a while we talked of various people we knew, and then
Ranville and Bartley got into a discussion as to where
was the best place to eat in London. Then, as there
came a lull in the conversation, Carter looked at his
watch and said that Patton was late. He was just on
the point of saying something else when the
telephone in the hall rang shrilly.</p>

<p>As I was nearest the door, I rose and, going into the
house, took the receiver from the hook. For a moment
I had trouble in hearing the person at the other end.
And then all at once the line was clear, and I recognized
Patton's voice—broken and hesitating but very much
excited and at the same time filled with horror. The
first question he asked was who was talking. I told
him and there came a pause. Then came the gasping,
excited words in a voice which shook:</p>

<p>“Pelt, for God's sake, get Bartley and Carter down
to the library. I am in here with the gardener, and
the man's dead—murdered.”</p>

<p>I gave a startled cry and stammered out something.
What it was I said I do not know; but he was too
excited to say more. Then came his voice again,
breaking with excitement, as he cried:</p>

<p>“Get them down here quick, Pelt—it is murder.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch15">

<h2>Chapter XV. <br> Another Murder</h2>

<p>Dumbfounded, I stood holding the receiver, too
dazed to even move. Then, frantically, I called Patton's
name, though the sharp click which came when he
hurriedly placed the receiver on the hook told me he had
rung off. Hastily hanging up the receiver, I rushed
into the living room and halted by the door. At my
sudden appearance, there was a pause in the
conversation. Bartley's eyes came to my face, rested, and he
rose quickly to his feet, his face very grave.</p>

<p>“What is it?” came his quick question.</p>

<p>“Another murder—at Warren's,” I stammered.</p>

<p>I saw Ranville's face stiffen into attention as he
slowly rose. Bartley's keen eyes never left my face,
and a trace of anxiety swept across his face. Carter
looked as though he did not believe me, but he asked
quickly:</p>

<p>“Who? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>I told them in a few words of Patton's voice and
what he had said. As I named the young professor, I
saw that Bartley was not only relieved, but also he
seemed rather puzzled. His eyes opened wider when
I said he had told me the gardener had been murdered.
But at the statement that Patton wanted us to come at
once, they all started for the door.</p>

<p>Carter, as he rushed out into the hall, said he would
get his big car from the garage. Bartley, with a sharp
command to wait a moment while he went to his room,
rushed up the stairs. Ranville and myself went out
on the veranda and watched Carter rush across the
grass and fling open the garage door. Immediately
there came the first sharp explosion of the engine, and
then it settled into a steady roar. He backed in a
sweeping circle to the drive. By the time we reached
the lawn Bartley came rushing down the steps with
a bag in his hand.</p>

<p>We fell into the car, and almost before we were
seated, Carter started with a jerk. Before we reached
the street it was in high, and we swept out of the
drive in a sharp curve. Then with the car increasing
in speed every second we started down the lighted
street. Not a word was said. I could see Carter's
face, set and determined, as he drove his car, first at
forty, then crept to fifty, and settled down around
sixty. Down the wide street we swept, with people
turning to look at us in amazement as we dashed past
them with the siren wide open.</p>

<p>As we came around the bend of the street, where the
road led straight as an arrow to Warren's estate,
Ranville spoke. He was the first one to speak since we
had left the house. And what he said seemed far
more spoken to himself than any one else.</p>

<p>“So there is something in the library that some one
is after,” came his musing voice.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Bartley shot back at him. “And what
is more, I have been afraid all day that this might
happen. I did not want a murder to take place, but if
something did happen—an attack on Patton or a
burglary—then it would prove a theory that I have.”</p>

<p>With a glance over his shoulder, Carter shot out:</p>

<p>“Got another one of your hunches, John?”</p>

<p>The car was slowing down. In front of us, through
the gathering dusk, loomed the wall which enclosed the
Warren estate. As the car stopped and we jumped out,
Bartley answered Carter's question.</p>

<p>“Call it that, Carter,” he said. “I think we will
discover something to-night.”</p>

<p>Nothing else was said, and on a half run we rushed
through the gate and up the path which led to the
house. As we turned to the path which ran through
the hedges, I gave one glance back at the house.
Through the semi-darkness there came the friendly
gleam of a light, but there were no signs of confusion,
or of any one about. Up the path we ran, and then,
as the hedge ended, we could see the eight-sided library
before us.</p>

<p>Every light seemed to be on, and the front door was
slightly open. But of Patton we did not see a sign
until we rushed into the building. Then we saw him
standing silently near the desk. He whirled around as
we entered, and I saw a look of relief sweep his face.
One thing struck me sharply—in his hand was a
revolver—a revolver which he was gripping firmly.</p>

<p>He started down the room to meet us. His face
seemed strained, though there was no fear in it. The
color had gone out of his cheeks as if there had come
some sudden shock. He said nothing, but as we reached
his side, he took us around the desk and pointed to the
door at the extreme end of the room. For a moment
I saw nothing, and then as I took one step forward, I
paused and came to a halt. For there by the door,
huddled in a heap on the floor, lay the figure of a
man—a man who did not move, a man whose appearance
seemed to fill the silent room with dignity, a man
whom I knew in a glance was dead.</p>

<p>Silently we went down the length of the room and
came to a pause by the body. It was lying on its
face, with the feet toward the desk; one hand was
reaching forth in a pathetic position as if in the last
moment of life it had tried to stretch toward the safety
of the open door a few feet away. As I looked at the
figure, I was impressed with the fact that the man
was wearing a suit very similar to Patton's—of some
indescribable dark stuff. Not only that, save for the
difference in years, the figure was about the same
build and hair almost the same color.</p>

<p>This thought lasted only a moment. Bartley dropped
silently to his knees and gently lifted the still head.
We bent forward to observe the man's face, and then
there passed a glance between Ranville and myself,
for the cold face with the staring eyes was that of the
man who worked around Warren's place. I started to
say something, only to have Bartley speak first.</p>

<p>“He was shot through the heart, from behind. I
think he must have been leaving the room when the
shot was fired.”</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and cast a reflective look back
to the desk, then hurried across the floor. Silently we
followed him, and when we reached the desk, we
received another surprise. It was a very large desk, with
a great deal of room underneath. By its side stood a
wastebasket, but the wastebasket was filled to
overflowing with small pieces of paper—paper torn into
hundreds of small pieces, which spilled over the side
of the basket and over the floor—typewritten sheets
torn into hundreds of tiny bits.</p>

<p>Bartley picked up a handful of paper and tried to
fit some of the pieces together. He found this rather
difficult, and then stood looking thoughtfully at the
basket. I took several pieces of the paper in my hands
and discovered that they once had been part of some
typewritten manuscript. Ranville gave one look at the
basket, glimpsed the typewritten letters, then glanced
hurriedly at the desk.</p>

<p>“It looks as though some one went to considerable
effort to destroy a manuscript.”</p>

<p>Patton's voice came sharp and quick. “They did;
I found that mess of papers on the floor. When I left
the room there lay on my desk several hundred pages of
Warren's notes. And now—now they are torn to a
thousand pieces. And”—he paused—“for the life of me
I cannot understand it.”</p>

<p>Patton's face, as he looked at the destroyed
manuscript, showed that he was facing a situation which was
beyond him. Not only was he very much disturbed,
but also rather frightened at what had taken place. It
was with a great deal of eagerness that he started to
answer the request Bartley made—to tell us just what
had happened.</p>

<p>“Carter brought me over, you know. I was unable
to do very much until the girl, who had acted as Mr.
Warren's secretary, came. She came to the library
about one and showed me what had been done. I
found that Warren had half completed his book. In
fact I never looked at any of his material beyond where
he had ended. He was half finished, and I thought it
would be best to see just what had been done.”</p>

<p>Bartley gave a quick look at the pieces of paper
upon the floor and asked: “Then this torn paper is
simply the notes and materials which Warren used in
the first portion of his book?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I left the papers upon the desk when I went
out. As I told you, I did not go beyond what Warren
had already done. I wanted to become familiar with
his plan. For that matter, the untouched notes are
still in the safe. But when I returned to the library,
I found the condition which you see.”</p>

<p>“It looks as if some one simply destroyed those papers
in a fit of rage,” was Carter's comment.</p>

<p>I saw Ranville turn to Bartley and their eyes met;
but they said nothing, and it was Patton's excited voice
which broke the silence:</p>

<p>“That's right, Carter. Of all fool things, the biggest
one was to destroy that mass of notes I left on the desk.
The manuscript of the book, the half which Warren had
completed, is still in the safe.”</p>

<p>“You say you left the library?”</p>

<p>Patton nodded. “Yes; about five o'clock the
secretary went home for her lunch. She was to return again
in an hour. I remembered what you told me—not to
leave the library unguarded if I went out.”</p>

<p>“What!” came Carter's startled voice as he turned
to Bartley. “Do you mean to tell me you expected
something like this to happen?”</p>

<p>Bartley's eyes went down the length of the room
to the still figure at the door. There was a note of
sorrow in his voice as he replied briefly:</p>

<p>“I expected something.”</p>

<p>Carter gave a start, his face expressing a good deal
of amazement. The Englishman, however, did not
seem at all surprised by what had been said. And then
Patton went on to tell why he had left the library. It
was a very simple thing; he wanted some tobacco and
he discovered that he had none in his pockets. Not
finding any in the library, he went out leaving the
door open. That was a little after five. Down by the
iron gate he found the gardener and asked him to go
and stay in the library until he returned. This was the
first hint I had received that the gardener was still
working on the estate.</p>

<p>The gardener had said that he would go in a moment
or so, adding that no one could reach the building
without passing up the path. With this, Patton had
wandered down the street to the business section and had
gone into the first store he noticed, bought tobacco and
an evening paper. As he figured it, he was not away
from the grounds more than thirty or forty minutes,
returning directly after making his purchase. When he
came up the path and entered the library, the first thing
he saw was the hundreds of bits of paper on the floor,
and that the manuscript was destroyed.</p>

<p>That was the first thing. Almost in the same
moment he saw the figure lying by the rear door. He
ran over to its side—to discover it was the gardener
and that he was dead—shot. He was so dazed for a
moment that he did nothing. Then he went to the
phone and called us.</p>

<p>It was a simple story, and yet an amazing one.
That in the space of one hour—in the time it took
Patton to go to a store and buy some tobacco—another
murder had been committed in the scientist's library;
it seemed almost beyond belief. But that the
gardener—a simple-minded man of his type—should be the
victim was even more startling. I started to voice my
thought, but Carter was ahead of me.</p>

<p>“But, John! Why—why under God should any
person kill that gardener?”</p>

<p>“They never intended to kill the gardener,” came
Ranville's dry voice.</p>

<p>Bartley gave him a keen look, commenting:</p>

<p>“Ranville is right. No one ever intended to kill
the gardener. They wanted—that is, if they wished to
kill any one—to murder Patton.”</p>

<p>“But,” came Patton's wailing voice, “why should
any one wish to kill me?”</p>

<p>Bartley's eyes met Ranville's, and it was the
Englishman who spoke:</p>

<p>“I am not so sure that they intended to kill you,
Patton. Though if any one was to be killed, why
you were the logical victim. What I think happened
was this: they thought they killed you. You and the
gardener are about the same build. You are both
wearing a dark suit to-day, and your height is the
same. When they shot at that man, they thought they
were shooting you.”</p>

<p>“But—” Patton started in a bewildered voice. He
was interrupted by Bartley's statement:</p>

<p>“Ranville is right, I think; but we might go even
further. It is my idea that the murderer never
discovered who it was he killed. He thought he killed
Patton.”</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” was Carter's question.</p>

<p>“I may be wrong, you understand. But it seems to
me something like this happened. The gardener, when
he said he could see any one come up the path, forgot
it was an easy matter for a person to land on the shore
in a boat. The trees would hide him from any person
down by the gate. I have an idea also that the
gardener never hurried about coming to the library. He
took his own time and for some unknown reason went
to the back door instead of the front one.”</p>

<p>“I don't see how you make that out,” broke in
Patton.</p>

<p>“Look where he was killed,” came the quick response
from Ranville.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bartley slowly. “Look where the body
was lying. You find it on its face with one hand
reaching for the door—the open door only a few inches
away. The man was shot in the back while his face
was turned away from the person who shot him. He
fell, naturally, in the position in which we found him.
And that makes me think the gardener came in the rear
door, got several feet within the building, when all
at once he saw the person engaged in destroying the
manuscript.”</p>

<p>“But why did he turn to leave then?” was my
question.</p>

<p>“It is my idea that when he turned to get out of the
library, the other person had not seen him. Perhaps,
even, the gardener knew who it was. He managed to
go several feet before the man fired. I believe when
he fired and the man fell and did not stir, he thought
he had killed Patton. From the back, with the same
colored suit, and the same general build, they look a
bit alike.”</p>

<p>It seemed logical enough, and I could tell from the
men's faces that they agreed. Then all at once Carter
gave a sudden cry and said that we must get the chief.
He started for the telephone, only to have Bartley call
out to him:</p>

<p>“George, don't tell the chief what we want him for.
Tell him to come right up here, but say nothing about
the murder. I have my reasons.”</p>

<p>Carter shrugged his shoulders and, after fooling with
the phone for some time, managed to get the chief.
When he returned to our side, he said the chief was
puzzled, wishing to know for what he was wanted, but
he would come up right away.</p>

<p>With this, we started to examine the room. But
after a quick, though very careful, search on the part
of Ranville and Bartley, there was nothing of
importance found. Only the small pieces of torn paper, which
filled the wastebasket and littered the floor by the
desk, showed that anything had been touched. There
was no doubt these pieces of paper had once comprised
Warren's notes—the notes which Patton said he had
left on the desk.</p>

<p>As we went over to the front door, Ranville, who
was in the lead, bent over, and as he straightened up,
held in his hand a magazine—a very popular
magazine with a gay cover of a girl in a scanty bathing suit.
As Bartley saw it, he gave one glance, then turned to
Patton.</p>

<p>“Two questions, Patton. Did you slip on the rug,
and did you buy this magazine when you went to the
store?”</p>

<p>The rug was a small Turkish one which we had
noticed the various times we had been in the library.
The colors were so beautiful that no one could help
noticing it. It was always just inside the door, but now
it was rumpled and disturbed, laying partly across the
doorsill. As I looked at it, I decided that some one
had slipped upon it.</p>

<p>Patton gave the magazine one glance, then gazed at
the rug. He slowly shook his head, saying:</p>

<p>“It is ‘no’ to both questions.”</p>

<p>“Somebody slipped on that rug,” commented Carter.</p>

<p>“And when they went out of the room,” added
Ranville. “It's dragged over the sill. If they stumbled
when they entered the room, it would be lying farther
inside the library.”</p>

<p>He bent a second and then fell to his knees,
apparently interested in something he found by the sill.
Scraping the substance with his knife, which he had
taken from his pockets, he rose extending his hand to
Bartley.</p>

<p>“It's mud,” he said.</p>

<p>We came closer to observe. There in his hand were
a few bits of dried dirt—dirt which evidently had been
wet only a short time ago. As Bartley saw it, he
reached forth to crumple a piece of it between his
fingers. Then he went out on the veranda and down
the three steps to the ground. At the bottom step he
bent down and then called:</p>

<p>“You will find more of it here.”</p>

<p>On the edge of the bottom step there were
unmistakable signs of a muddy shoe. The signs were not plain
enough to form a footprint, but one could see that
some person in going up the steps must have brushed
off the mud from their shoes. Patton gave it one look,
then straightened up to say:</p>

<p>“That's not mine. I never went within a mile of any
mud.”</p>

<p>Bartley was on the verge of a reply when we heard
some one hail us at the bottom of the slight hill.
Turning, we saw the chief hurrying across the lawn. His
face was red as if he had been running, and when he
stopped at our side, he gave us a very wondering look.
There was no doubt he was very curious as to why
he had been called so suddenly again to the library.</p>

<p>In a few short words Bartley told him of the dead
man that was within. His eyes opened wide at the
information, and his jaw dropped when Bartley told him
it was the gardener who was dead. Then as he started
for the house, Bartley's hand went forth and touched
his arm:</p>

<p>“Chief, don't call up your office for several hours.
Get your coroner if you must, but try and get him out
here without any one knowing what has taken place.”</p>

<p>As the chief turned a puzzled face in his direction
and started to protest, Bartley continued:</p>

<p>“I have my reasons, Chief, and they are good. If
you keep this thing still for several hours, I have an
idea I can come pretty close to putting my hand on the
murderer.”</p>

<p>We all gave him a startled glance. So far as I could
see, not only was Warren's murder destined to become
one of the unsolved crimes, but this deepened the
mystery. There had been no apparent reason for Warren's
death, for the gardener's there was none at all. True,
Bartley had said the gardener had been killed in
mistake for Patton; but there was no reason in the world
why any person should have wished to kill Patton. But
here was Bartley calmly saying that he thought he
might be able to discover the murderer. And it needed
only one look at his set face to know he was sincere
in his belief.</p>

<p>Puzzled, though not protesting, the chief agreed to
what Bartley had asked, and then turned again to the
house. Telling him we would be with him in a few
moments, we watched the heavy figure ascend the steps
and vanish within the room. Then, when he had passed
from our sight, Bartley said:</p>

<p>“Twice we have heard about a boat in connection
with this affair. Now, if the murderer wished to enter
the grounds without being seen, it is reasonable to
assume he used a boat. The traces of mud that we
found show he was in some water. With this dry
weather we are having water is hard to find.”</p>

<p>With that he started across the lawn and down
through the trees. The estate ended by the lake, which
was several hundred feet away. Along the edges of
the water low-hanging willow trees formed a leafy
green screen. The trees were rather close together;
a person could have landed on the shore without much
chance of being seen by any one who was a few feet
away.</p>

<p>We pushed through the branches to find that the
shore line was several feet below the grass embankment.
Below the grass a soft silt formed the shore, and the
water was very shallow for some yards out. As I
turned and looked through the low branches—branches
which in places dropped below the bank and almost
touched the water—I discovered that I could not see
the library.</p>

<p>By the water's edge we scattered. Carter and I
went down the grass to our right, while Bartley and
Ranville followed the shore in the direction to where the
wall ended at the water. We had not taken more than
four steps when there came Bartley's voice, and we
hurried to where he and Ranville were standing.</p>

<p>They were several feet away from the wall. It
came, not only down to the water, but extended a few
feet into the lake. The heavy stones had caused the
water to hollow out a little curve just inside the estate.
It was here that Bartley was pointing. Below us the
soft silt—almost mud—extended for several feet into
the lake. And there was no doubt, from a deep
impression in the mud, that a boat had been run ashore at
this very spot. Not only could one see where the boat
had landed, but what is more, where some one had
jumped for the shore, missed the bank, and had placed
one foot in the silt.</p>

<p>“That boat did not leave there so very long ago,”
came Ranville's comment, as we all looked at the
impression. “There is a slight breeze on the lake, the
water is lapping against the shore, and in an hour that
impression in the mud will be all smoothed out.”</p>

<p>Bartley nodded, then bent over the bank to study the
impression. He rose with a very perplexed look on his
face and began to go slowly over the near-by grass.
Suddenly he stopped and turned quickly.</p>

<p>“That's not all, Ranville. The man in the boat got
one foot in the water when he got out. You can see
the dirt where it fell from the edge of the bank. But
when he came back, he had something with
him—something heavy. Maybe he carried it, but he had
to half drag it into the boat. Look,” and he pointed
to the bank.</p>

<p>There, a little away from the spot where the
impression was in the mud, were two places a foot
apart—places where the grass was tangled and matted, and
where the bank itself was broken down. It did look as
though something had been dragged over the bank to
the boat. As Bartley looked, his face grew very white,
and I saw his hands open and close. He turned to
Patton, and his voice was crisp as he shot out:</p>

<p>“Patton, that was not your magazine we found in
the library.”</p>

<p>Patton shook his head. He might have replied, but
Bartley gave him no time. The voice was insistent as
he asked:</p>

<p>“You said the girl—the secretary—was to return to
the library and work an hour?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; she went to supper and was to come
about six and work until seven. Carter told me we were
to eat at seven.”</p>

<p>“And you never saw her again after she left?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I did,” was Patton's unemotional answer.
“Yes, I did. I saw her going up the street toward
Warren's when I was in the tobacco store. If I had not
stopped to talk for a few moments, I would have been
able to catch up with her. Why, what's the matter?”</p>

<p>Bartley's grave glance went to Ranville's face. As
the Englishman looked at him, to my surprise I saw
the red fade slowly from his face. Very gravely he
started to nod his head when there came Bartley's
quick voice:</p>

<p>“What's the matter? Good Lord! Don't you see
that the girl must have come up the path just about
the moment the gardener was shot? Don't you see she
must have walked right into the library, perhaps while
the murderer held the gun in his hand—perhaps even
at the very moment of shooting? She was there; the
magazine on the floor was hers.”</p>

<p>Carter gave a sudden start, and Patton's face grew
white. He was the first to stammer out:</p>

<p>“But where is she now?”</p>

<p>Bartley's eyes swept over the water of the lake and
rested on the faint impression in the silt—an impression
now almost smoothed out. Then, pointing to the
bedraggled grass and the place where the bank was
broken, he said slowly:</p>

<p>“She must have been at the front door just as the
murder took place. Whoever did the killing dragged
the girl down across the lawn and to the boat. Her
feet, as they dragged along the grass, broke down the
edge of the bank.”</p>

<p>He paused and there came a moment of horrified
silence. It needed but one glance at Ranville to see
that he agreed with Bartley. From Carter's
expression as he gazed at the broken place in the bank, I
could tell he believed the same. Only Patton seemed
too dazed to comprehend what it might mean.</p>

<p>And then as our glances met, Bartley, for one of the
few times in his life, uttered an oath and started to run
toward the library. As the rest of us stood, hesitatingly,
Bartley turned—turned to cry back at us in a voice that
shook a little:</p>

<p>“For God's sake, hurry! We may be just in time
to prevent another murder, and this time the most
horrible one of all.”</p>

<h2>Chapter XVI. <br> The Voice in the Dark</h2>

<p>It had been an afternoon filled with unexpected
things. But even the murder of the gardener had not
startled me as much as the horrified exclamation of
Bartley. No one thought of disbelieving him or even
questioning what he had said. There would not have
been time for the latter, for he was running up the
hill in the direction of the library. Without a word
Ranville had started after him, and after our first
stunned second of surprise Carter, Patton and I
followed.</p>

<p>What Bartley had meant by saying we might be in
time to prevent another murder I could not
understand; but the tone of conviction in his voice when
he had said this was overwhelming. He knew
something of which the rest of us had not the slightest idea.</p>

<p>He reached the library before we did. In fact,
when we went up on the veranda and paused at the open
door, he was talking to the chief very seriously and
quickly. We had no time to enter the room before
he came to our side. Just as we followed him down the
steps, he turned and called to the chief, who had come
to the door:</p>

<p>“Remember; say nothing to any one about the
murder of the gardener. Wait until you hear from me.”</p>

<p>We hurried down the path and out to the car waiting
before the iron gate. Carter climbed into the front seat,
and Ranville and I took the back seat with Bartley. At
his command to rush to the house, Carter guided the
car around in a sweeping curve, and started down the
street. In a moment we were going over fifty miles
an hour.</p>

<p>I shot a glance at Bartley. He was leaning back
in his seat, but I could tell that his body was tense.
There was a burning flame in his eyes, and his lips
were shut in a thin line. As the car swept around the
bend and then headed straight for Carter's, Ranville
asked in a questioning voice:</p>

<p>“You have found something, John?”</p>

<p>There came a quick response. “I think so. It may
be that I am wrong. To me it seems the theory I have
is the only solution there can be to this case. I had a
theory when you told me of Warren's death—a vague
one. Now the death of the gardener makes it the
only solution in sight.”</p>

<p>“It seemed a crazy thing to kill the gardener,” was
Ranville's comment.</p>

<p>Bartley gave him one quick look. The car was
lurching into Carter's drive and was already on the
verge of stopping. As it came to a pause, Bartley
answered the questioning comment of the Englishman.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the only thing he said.</p>

<p>We piled out of the car onto the lawn. I noticed
that Bartley stood a moment, his gaze apparently fixed
upon some point. It was already dark, and would soon
be much darker. In the sky the clouds were hanging
low and black, with the promise of rain any moment.
The wind was rising and already was sweeping across
the lake in stormy gusts. Down in the garage the
dog, hearing the car stop, howled long and loudly.</p>

<p>For some reason Bartley did not seem to be in the
same hurry as a few moments before. We followed
him into the house and watched him go up the stairs
to his room. Carter, who had been watching him with
a puzzled air, turned to me and asked:</p>

<p>“Do you know what is on his mind?”</p>

<p>I shook my head, started to speak, only to hear
Bartley from above calling to Carter to be sure and get
his gun. With a startled glance at Ranville, Carter
gave a shrug of his shoulders and left the room. Both
he and Bartley returned at the same moment, and it
needed but a glance at the squatty automatic which
he carried to see he had obeyed his friend's
instructions.</p>

<p>But though he had obeyed it, he was not satisfied.
In a voice which was bursting with curiosity he turned
to Bartley.</p>

<p>“For God's sake, John! What have you up your
sleeve?”</p>

<p>“Carter,” came the slow reply, “there is not time
to tell you now just what I am afraid of, but I have
the idea we are going to put our hands on the murderer
of both Warren and the gardener. That is not my
chief object. I am going to save the secretary from a
similar fate.”</p>

<p>“I don't see how you can say that—” burst from
Carter's lips.</p>

<p>He would have said more, but his friend placed his
arm around his shoulder saying:</p>

<p>“I may be wrong, Carter. But you know my way of
working very well. There is but one logical solution
to this entire affair; that is the one I am going to test
now. If I am wrong, there is no damage done; but
if I am right, then I save further trouble. I only ask
you to do one thing; do not lose your head. Say
nothing, and if you have to shoot, do not be afraid
of shooting to kill.”</p>

<p>Bartley led the way out of the hall. As we reached
the front door, he slipped a revolver in the hands of
Ranville and myself. And at that second for the first
time I discovered Patton was not with us and had not
come into the house when we got out of the car. In a
surprised voice I asked where he might be—asked, only
to have Bartley respond that Patton was following a
suggestion he had made, and that we would see him in
a short while.</p>

<p>With Bartley in the lead we went down the steps
and across the grass. Where we were going, I did not
have the slightest idea and wondered greatly. I half
expected we would take the car, but instead he struck
off over the lawn in the other direction. This puzzled
me, and as we came to the opening in the hedge, I
became more perplexed than ever. For the high hedge
separated Carter's grounds from the wide sweeping
lawn which ran to the stone church.</p>

<p>Even in the few moments we had been in the house,
the wind had increased. Now it came sweeping across
the lake from the distant mountains—not in the wild
gusts of a few moments before, but with a steady
strength which seemed to be increasing. A few drops
of rain dashed against my face, and I could hear the
lake as it started to pound upon the shore. The clouds
seemed very low, and not a star was in the sky.</p>

<p>As we came through the hedge, for the first time
we felt the full strength of the wind. Out in the street,
where the few street lamps gave the only brightness in
the dense darkness, I saw a newspaper go whirling up
the hill in a crazy fashion. In front of us, just an
indistinct dark mass in the gloom, was the church. No
lights were to be seen at the rectory windows, and save
for the wind no other sound came to our ears.</p>

<p>With Bartley a few steps in front of us, we went up
the slight incline and across the close-cropped grass
which formed the lawn. Where we were heading, I
could not tell; but Bartley kept in the lead, hurrying
with the certainty of a man who knew just where he
was going and what he expected to discover. We
followed, though several feet behind. No one spoke,
and as we bent forward against the wind, I wondered
what Carter and Ranville might be thinking.</p>

<p>We paused under the shadow of the tower, which
divided the church from the rectory. It loomed above
us in the darkness, but as I put out my hand, I
discovered that the door leading to the top was closed. I
pressed down the latch, only to find the door was locked.
I had begun to wonder why we had stopped in the place
we did when above the roar of the wind I heard a
sound. At first I could not tell what it was, for it rose
for a second and died away—rose and fell, to suddenly
swell forth into a great volume of sound. And then I
recognized what it was. Some one was playing the
organ in the church.</p>

<p>Ranville started to speak, and in fact said one word,
but there came a sharp command from Bartley, and he
became silent. As Bartley started in the direction of the
church, we followed. We crept along the ivy-covered
wall and reached the three steps which led to the
entrance. When we were before the oak door and tried
the latch, we found it was locked. Stopping a moment,
we listened. Above the wind the notes of the organ
came faintly from within.</p>

<p>I half expected Bartley might pound on the door,
though why he should care to enter the church I could
not see. Instead, he walked down to the grass, and we
went to his side. Our eyes turned toward the rich glass
windows of the building. In the darkness it was almost
impossible to even perceive the place where they were.
One thing was certain; though some one was within the
church—some one playing upon the pipe organ—yet the
church was dark. Not a ray of light was reflected
from the windows out into the darkness.</p>

<p>Puzzled by this, we followed Bartley back again to
the side of the church, and this time paused directly
under one of the windows. It was placed only a few
feet above the ground, for the church building was
rather low. At Bartley's suggestion I placed myself
so he could step on my hand and reach the window
sill. Reaching it, he stood balanced against the glass
for some moments, then dropped to the ground without
a word. Coming to our side, he said shortly:</p>

<p>“There is some one in the church, and there seems
to be a light there. But it is a very feeble one at the
best. We will go down to the last window. This time
we will let Pelt look inside and tell us what he sees.”</p>

<p>We went down the side of the church until we reached
the last window. Here Bartley aided me as I scrambled
up to the sill and stood upon the rather large ledge.
The window was partly covered over with ivy, but I
found a clear place and pressed my face against the
glass. For a while as I looked within, I saw nothing.
In fact, the church was simply a vast dark cave, the
darkness so dense that I could not distinguish any of
the objects within.</p>

<p>But I did discover something else. Somewhere near
my ear there must have been a hole in the glass,
or a broken section, for the sound of the organ was
much louder than when I heard it before. Within the
church some one was playing—playing with a feeling
and a power which was hard to describe. The loud
notes rolled down to my ear, increasing, it seemed, in
sound every second. And the music was
indescribable, like nothing I had ever heard before and, for that
matter, nothing that I would care to hear again.</p>

<p>It seemed to contain a note of victory mingled with
some wild, barbaric strain of exaltation; music unlike
anything I had ever heard before, and music, which
for some unknown reason, made my blood run cold.
One thing was certain, whatever was being played
it was not the type of music which one hears in a
church. The wild, barbaric strains, now shrieking
forth in gleeful triumph, now seeming to cry defiance
to one's enemies, was not church music. It was too
loud and far too primitive for that. And then,
suddenly, I saw something.</p>

<p>With my face pressed against the glass, I had tried
to penetrate the darkness within. But the gloom hid
everything from sight as if a heavy thick blanket had
been drawn across my vision. As my glance swept
down the length of the church and then upward, I
suddenly saw a light. It was the merest pin point of a
light, far up in the organ loft. As I gazed at the speck
of brightness in the darkness, I saw something else.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that the light must be from a candle
placed somewhere upon the organ. It was so small that
it could not give much illumination. From where I was
it did not seem much larger than a dollar. But beside
the light, mostly in the shadow, could be seen the
indistinct figure of a man—a man bent over the
keyboard of the organ, his figure swaying back and forth
as he played. But it was impossible to distinguish who
the man might be.</p>

<p>With the wild notes of the organ ringing in my ears,
I dropped to the ground and told what I had observed.
Bartley turned at once to the window and, with my
assistance, climbed upon the sill. For several moments,
with his face against the glass, he remained motionless.
Then, sliding to the ground, he came to our side.</p>

<p>“Is there a balcony in the church?” he asked Carter.</p>

<p>Carter thought a moment and replied that he thought
there was. Then Bartley said he wished Carter and I to
go into the church and to reach the balcony. He and
Ranville would join us in a short while. If we succeeded
in getting into the balcony without being heard, we
were to simply watch the person playing the organ and
wait until Bartley joined us. We started to ask him
what he expected would be discovered. He made no
reply to the question; instead he said he thought he
would be able to pick the lock of the front door of the
church.</p>

<p>Wondering just why he wished us to go into the
church and, above all, puzzled as to where he and
Ranville might be going, we followed him to the church
entrance. For a second the flame from his flash light
played upon the great door. Then as we screened him,
Bartley fumbled for a moment or so with the lock,
using a thin piece of steel, and before we knew it the
door was open.</p>

<p>With a whisper that we might close the door, as he
could open it again, Bartley slipped away in the
darkness. Silently, Carter and I stole softly into the church.
As we closed the door behind us, we stopped a moment
to listen. There came to our ears the muffled sound of
the organ, telling us the man was still playing. With
a whisper that we did not have to be very careful as
the organ would drown out any noise we made, Carter
turned on his flash light.</p>

<p>The flame lasted but a moment, but long enough to
allow us to get our bearings. We were in the
vestibule of the church. On each side of the hallway stairs
ran to the other floor, no doubt to a balcony. In
the front near the stairs were two doors leading into
the church. They were glass doors, but the glass was
covered with some sort of cloth.</p>

<p>There was not much necessity to be over quiet. The
organ prevented any sound we might make from
being heard. We went to the stairs, and with our hands
on the wall climbed to the next floor. We crept
carefully through several rows of chairs and managed to
reach the front railing of the balcony without any
noise. There we sank back in the nearest chairs and
peered over the rail.</p>

<p>Before us the church stretched away to the organ
loft, which was above the pulpit. Below us lay a great
pit of darkness, while almost on a level with us we
could see the tiny splotch of light—a light which
flickered and twisted as the flame of a candle will. It was
set somewhere upon the organ, for we could catch
the reflection of several of the golden pipes. But
the man at the keys we could not distinguish. There
was but the black outline of his figure as, with head
bent low, he played to the silent church.</p>

<p>As we sat there in the darkness, it dawned upon me
that perhaps never again would I hear such music—that
is, if one could call the wild strains which came
from the organ music. It was unlike anything I have
ever heard, wild, fantastic and even devilish in its
suggestion. For the first time I began to understand
what some people had in mind when they called
certain music immoral. Now the tones would swell, swell
until the echo reverberated from the wall. Next it
would die down to a soft, sobbing croon to last but a
moment, and then suddenly burst forth in a wild
satanic laugh. It was the eeriest music I have ever heard,
and as time passed on, it seemed to frighten me.</p>

<p>Then came a moment when the organ died down to
a strain so low we could barely hear it. In that
second, suddenly there was a terrific flash of lightning—one
which threw the rich glass of the windows in high
relief and caused the interior of the church to flare
for a moment into sight. Then followed a heavy crash
of thunder, which seemed to roll down the roof of the
church. The next instant there came the heavy
dashing of rain upon the roof above our heads. And all at
once, as the sound of the thunder died away, the organ
seemed to falter, and the music stopped with a sudden
crash. At the same time the light in the organ loft
went out.</p>

<p>As the light vanished, Carter gripped my arm.
Bending over the railing, I tried to figure out what had
happened as if the very tenseness of my gaze could
pierce the blackness. A sound behind caused me to
jump, but the next instant there came Bartley's low
whisper:</p>

<p>“It's all right, Pelt. Keep still.”</p>

<p>There came another flash of lightning more vivid
than before, which seemed to play across the window
above the organ, a window which was blood-red in the
second I was able to see it. The clap of thunder which
followed appeared to shake the church to its very
foundation. And then in that second of silence which
seems to follow a thunderclap, there came ringing
through the black church a voice—a voice unlike
anything I have ever heard. The tone exultant,
triumphant, ringing above the sound of the rain upon the roof
and the sweep of the wind around the building. A
voice chanting a disconnected series of words.</p>

<p>“A sign, O Lord. A sign to thy servant. The
Lord will deliver his enemies into my hands. A sign,
O Lord. A sign I cried for. And it came, it came.”</p>

<p>The shrill voice rose higher and higher until the
broken phrases were almost a shriek. I felt Carter's
hand sink into my arm. In his intensity he did not
know that his grip was painful. None of us moved,
but I heard a short gasp come from some one. And I
knew that the eyes of the three were trying, like my
own, to pierce the darkness.</p>

<p>The voice died away to a sobbing whisper, then all
became still. Above our heads the rain was dashing
in sheets against the roof. Somewhere outside I heard
the shrill wail of an automobile as the driver blew the
horn. But within the church was only darkness and
silence. Again there came a vivid flash of lightning,
followed by the rumble of the thunder. As it died away
the voice rose again—rose in a wailing cry:</p>

<p>“A sign to thy servant. A sacrifice to thy power.”</p>

<p>Silence again, in which I tried to figure out just where
the man might be. That he was somewhere in the front
of the church I knew, somewhere near the altar. But
why the candle had been extinguished, and above all
why he should stay in the darkness I could not tell.
Of one thing I was certain. No sane man had been
playing the organ. And the voice we had heard had
tones and inflections which I had never heard in any
normal person.</p>

<p>Again came the voice. This time it was not so shrill,
but far more serious—speaking with the tone of one
who was lifted above the world by some mystical
vision within them, and yet the tone and the words
made me shudder.</p>

<p>“Blood—will wipe away all sins. Blood—” the
voice wailed.</p>

<p>I heard a muttered “God” in a horrified voice from
Carter. He half started to rise, only to fall back in his
seat at Bartley's whispered command.</p>

<p>The voice came again above the sound of the rain
and the noise of the wind—the words came ringing
down to us through the darkness:</p>

<p>“Blood will wipe away all sins,” were the words
chanted in a singsong voice. “Blood. A sacrifice upon
the altar.”</p>

<p>The voice died away. There came a muttering, the
words so low that we could not hear a single one. For
several moments it went on. Suddenly it ceased, and
we heard the sound of some one stumbling down some
steps—stumbling and half falling. Then came the
sound of feet half running—running down the aisle of
the church—running, yet stumbling and falling against
the pews. At the sound Bartley whispered:</p>

<p>“Down the stairs! Let the man get out on the lawn,
and then follow him. Do not let him see us.”</p>

<p>We groped our way up the short aisle, then down
the stairs which led to the vestibule. Just as we
reached the turn in the steps, we heard the man
fumbling with the front door—heard him fling it open, and
then followed the loud bang as the wind slammed it
shut. With that we leaped down the remaining steps,
across the hallway to the door. In a second some
one had flung it open.</p>

<p>As we piled out on the lawn, the rain swept across
our faces. Coming from the dense darkness of the
church, we found we could see but a few feet ahead
of us. Though we looked on all sides, we saw nothing
of the man. Suddenly there came a flash of lightning,
and in the glare I saw far down the lawn a running
figure—a figure headed for the lake.</p>

<p>We started on a run, Bartley a little in the lead.
The lake was several hundred yards away, and above
the wind I could hear the water as it dashed against
the shore. By the aid of another flash of lightning, we
glimpsed for a second the dark figure. This time he was
almost by a small building which faced the water.</p>

<p>As we reached Bartley's side, Carter gasped:</p>

<p>“I think I know where the man is going. There is
a stone boat house down there.”</p>

<p>I wondered later why it was we were not observed,
for as the man reached the boat house, we heard him
fumble with the lock, and the door was slammed almost
in our faces. We stood for a second by the door of
the building. It was a small stone affair built of heavy
granite blocks. It stood directly upon the shore of the
lake, and the water was but a few feet away. As we
gazed at the building, suddenly far above our heads
came the reflection of a light from within. I gave a
start, for the light was directly above us. There came
Carter's quick voice:</p>

<p>“John, this place has no windows at all. It was once
a studio, and there is a large skylight in the roof.
When I was a kid, I often climbed on the roof and
watched the artists working inside.”</p>

<p>“Can you get up there now?” questioned Bartley.</p>

<p>“Without any trouble at all,” Carter retorted. “On
the other side of the building there is a big tree. You
can climb the tree, then go out on a branch and drop
on the roof. It's easy.”</p>

<p>Without a word Bartley rushed around the side of
the building, we after him. There we found it was as
Carter had said. There was a large tree several yards
from the building, and I could see from the light
reflected above the roof an overhanging branch. As the
limbs hung low, Bartley had no difficulty in climbing,
and I saw him drop upon the roof. In rapid
succession we followed him. For a moment as the branch
swayed with the wind I felt a feeling of suspense, but
in a second I dropped lightly on the roof of the
building.</p>

<p>A large skylight formed the larger part of the roof.
From it a light was streaming out into the night.
Bending over the skylight, their eyes intent on
something in the room below, were Carter and Bartley.
Ranville and myself reached the glass at the same
moment and bent forward to look into the room.</p>

<p>In the first glance I noticed nothing out of the way.
There was simply a large, unkempt room, littered with
old chairs and odds and ends. By the door which faced
the lake there was a small rowboat. Then my eyes
fell upon a broken-down sofa, which was in one corner
of the room and then I gave a quick gasp of horror, for
there upon the broken-down piece of furniture lay a
still figure—a person whose eyes were closed and whose
face was very white. Below us upon the sofa lay the
unconscious figure of the secretary.</p>

<p>My first startled thought was that she was dead.
But I saw the breast rise a little and knew that she
was breathing. She did not move, however, and her
eyes were closed. The white dress was stained with
dirt, and half of the thin waist was torn away from her
shoulder. One could see the white curve of her arm
and the ivory whiteness of the half-exposed breast.
Across the naked shoulder was a long red mark, either
a cut or a scratch. The dress was far above her knees,
and the rolled stockings exposed her legs, which were
covered with dirt.</p>

<p>The first startled thought had been one of surprise.
Though Bartley had told us that it was his opinion
the girl was in danger, yet for my part I had failed to
believe him. But as I looked down upon the
unconscious figure, I realized he had been right. Some one
started to speak when in the rear of the room a door
suddenly began to open.</p>

<p>I watched the door as it swung slowly open, and
then a man came into the room. His face I could
not see, for he entered in a sideways position with
the body bent far over. His hair was very much
disheveled, and the black suit which he wore was a mass
of wrinkles. Slowly, with his head bent low, he
shambled over to the sofa and, with the hands hanging down,
stood looking at the girl. The face I could not see, but
as I looked at the uncouth figure, it began to dawn
upon me that I knew who the man was.</p>

<p>Suddenly he raised the long thin arms above his
head and waved them in a threatening manner over
the unconscious girl. For a few seconds he stood silent,
then shuffled to the corner of the room and fumbled
under a bit of sail cloth. He straightened, his face still
hidden from my sight, and then to my consternation
I saw he held in his hand—a knife. As he raised it
above his head, the long thin steel caught the
reflection from the electric light and glittered in a strange
fashion. As if testing the force of his blow, he swept
the knife downward through the air and then turned to
gaze in a reflective manner at the form on the sofa.
At the same second I saw Ranville, who was next to me,
pull his revolver from his pocket.</p>

<p>For some reason the man remained quiet a moment,
then went very slowly to the opposite corner of the
room. From where we were on the roof we were
unable to see what he was doing. As I bent my face
closer to the glass, Bartley suddenly spoke in a low
voice:</p>

<p>“Carter, I am going to take Pelt and go down and
break in the door. You remember what I said. If
it is necessary, do not be afraid to shoot—and shoot
to kill. There may come just a second when it will
be a question of taking the life of that insane person
below or saving the girl. There is only one choice.”</p>

<p>With a touch on my shoulder to follow him he
went over to the branch of the tree and pulled himself
along to the trunk, when he slid to the ground. I
followed him, reaching the foot of the tree at almost the
same moment. Without a word he hurried around the
side of the building to the front door, I after him.
There, adjusting his flash light so the flame would
remain fixed, he turned it on the door.</p>

<p>There is a certain instrument by which any door
may be opened. It is, in fact, a very powerful lever
which simply forces the lock out of position and
crushes the door open. The door before us was of
heavy wood, and though he fumbled a moment at the
lock with a bit of steel, he had no success. Taking the
lever from his pocket, he applied it in the proper
manner and then began to use his strength. There came
the sound of creaking wood, a splintering crash as the
door gave way. And then, just as he started to push
it open, there came a voice from a figure running over
the lawn.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bartley,” cried the voice.</p>

<p>We turned quickly as Patton came in the range of
the flash light. He rushed to our side, much out of
breath, and his questioning eyes swept over the two of
us. Telling him to keep a little behind us, Bartley
turned again to the door. He gave it a push, then a
shove, and it swung open, ripped half off the hinges.</p>

<p>We found ourselves in a small entryway littered
with rubbish of all kinds. In front of us was a partly
opened door, and from the light which came through it
I knew it led into the room which we had looked down
upon. We took one step in the direction of the door
and then paused suddenly as a voice came ringing out
upon the silence:</p>

<p>“A sacrifice to the Most High,” pealed the voice.
And the tones were those of one carried away by some
stern purpose. They contained not only a note of
cruelty, but also one of high resolution—the voice of
one from whom sanity had long since departed.</p>

<p>“Blood—will—wash away all sin,” chanted the voice.
The tone rose higher and higher until it was almost a
shriek. “Blood—a sacrifice to the Most High—”
Then as the voice sank, there came a silence and the
half-sobbing refrain:</p>

<p>“The Lord chooses his servants to punish his
enemies—Blood—”</p>

<p>With a leap Bartley reached the half-open door
and flung it wide. I was in the room at almost the
same moment, and there for a second we stood. Before
us, the girl lay upon the sofa, and in the first quick
glance I gave I saw that she still did not move. Before
her stood the unkempt figure, his suit drenched by the
rain, holding in the right hand the long knife.</p>

<p>As we burst into the room, the man's voice died
away in his throat; he whirled around and glared at us.
His face was working convulsively, and the mouth
was partly open, showing the long narrow teeth. The
eyes glared at us in an unearthly manner, and his left
hand opened and closed. He gave us one startled
look—a look which contained nothing of recognition—and
half gathered himself for a spring. And then
suddenly there came a change in the expression of his
face.</p>

<p>The eyes which had swept over Bartley and myself
shifted their gaze to something which was behind us.
As we looked, the wild expression which had glared
at us began to fade away; instead there came a
half-bewildered look, the faint dawning of remembrance.
Slowly I saw a look of astonishment give place to the
greatest horror. He gave one step in our direction
and pointed a wavering hand at the object behind us.
I gave a quick look to see what it might be. But only
Patton stood behind us in the doorway.</p>

<p>Advancing very slowly, one foot in front of the
other, with the outstretched hands wavering, yet ever
pointing, the man took two steps in our direction. He
tried to speak, and I saw the lips move in a vain effort.
Then as his face worked strangely, there burst forth
the words in a half shriek:</p>

<p>“You—you. You were killed.”</p>

<p>Bartley's voice broke in upon the silence, cool and
sharp:</p>

<p>“No! You killed the wrong man.”</p>

<p>The uncouth figure half stumbled, and there came a
despairing moan from the trembling lips. The hand
dropped limply to his side. He gave one wild,
appealing look around the room, then his eyes came back to
Patton. I saw the veins in his forehead swell, and
his face flush a vivid red. He half started to gather
himself for a leap in our direction—started, only to
partly turn. There came a half groan from his lips—a
despairing cry, and then suddenly he fell with a
crash to the floor. Fell, to move his hands convulsively
for a moment, and then become very still. Carter's
next-door neighbor—the minister—lay dead at our feet.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch17">

<h2>Chapter XVII. <br> The Case Is Ended</h2>

<p>Several hours later found us gathered in Carter's
living room. It had been a very active two hours.
Our first attention had been given to the secretary,
for it needed but a glance to tell that the minister was
beyond any aid of ours. We carried her to Carter's
house, where his housekeeper placed her in bed, while
we called the doctor. We had reached both the coroner
and the chief of police, and when their duties had
been completed, they had all gathered in Carter's house.</p>

<p>We were a somber-looking group of men. The horror
and nervous tension of the last few hours was still
with us. No one felt very much at ease, and my eyes
still saw the amazing scene in the boat house. The
heavy face of the chief wore the most bewildered look
I have ever seen, and it seemed as if he still found it
impossible to believe all that had taken place. Only
Ranville and Bartley appeared to be unmoved, and the
Englishman's face wore an admiring look whenever he
glanced at Bartley.</p>

<p>It was the chief who voiced the thought which was
in all our minds. He turned to Bartley, and his heavy
voice asked the question we all wished answered.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bartley,” he asked, “for God's sake, tell us
how you doped out this thing. I can't believe yet the
minister killed those two men. To save my life I
can't see it.”</p>

<p>Bartley started to speak, only to be interrupted by
Carter's rising from his chair. Telling us he thought
the chief would pardon us if we took a little drink, he
left the room, returning in a moment. Under his
arm was a three-sided bottle, and glasses clinked in his
pockets. No one spoke while he poured out the Scotch,
and very soberly we each took our drink. Then
Carter turned to his friend.</p>

<p>“Now, John,” was all he said.</p>

<p>Fumbling in his pocket, Bartley found his cigar
case and slowly lighted one of the long thin cigars
he loved so well. Then, leaning far back in his chair,
he turned to the chief.</p>

<p>“As you know, Chief,” were his words, “the solving
of any crime is oftentimes a matter of luck. It is
not often we find clews scattered about which lead
us directly to the criminal. Most murders are solved
by very careful detail work by the police. Others are
solved by sheer good fortune, and a few by what we
might call a bit of psychology.”</p>

<p>I saw Ranville nod his head in agreement, but the
chief's face was a study. He started to say something,
only to check himself as Bartley continued:</p>

<p>“When I first read in the papers regarding the
murder of Warren, my first thought was, the whole thing
seemed incredible. Then I began to wonder what
the motive might be. There must always be some kind
of a motive for a murder. The crime is committed, of
course, for many reasons. In the main, there are but
three—robbery, revenge or sudden, frenzied passion.
When I read the accounts of Warren's death, every one
of these reasons seemed to be eliminated. In fact, the
more I thought it over the less there seemed to be of
any kind of motive.”</p>

<p>He paused to relight his cigar; then went on:</p>

<p>“Of course, the murder of a man of Warren's
prominence was startling enough in itself. As a rule, men
of his type are not murdered. Then I began to wonder.
There seemed on the face of it but one logical
explanation. Could he have been killed because of
something he might have done in China, by some enemies
he might have made while there? When Carter told
me of the visit made by the Chinaman, I began to
wonder if he might be the killer. In the end I decided
that he could not have been.”</p>

<p>“I don't see how you have decided that,” broke in the
chief.</p>

<p>“Two things formed my opinion. The cross upon
the forehead was the first one. A Chinaman might have
killed him, but if he did, he would not have marked the
body after death with a cross. Then came the story
of the box. We found there was a box of opium in the
library. Patton's information regarding the boxes given
Warren in China checked up with the story the
Chinaman told. But one box of opium was not enough for a
crime of that type. The Chinaman could have secured
the box at the time he was first in the library; that is,
if he had not been forced to leave.”</p>

<p>“To leave?” questioned Carter.</p>

<p>Bartley turned to his friend. “Carter, did you not
think it rather queer that the Chinaman left the library
as quickly as he did? He had discovered Warren was
dead. To him that was of little account. But it seems
that either he must have seen some one returning to
the building or else heard some one near the room. One
thing he could not afford to have happen: that was
take any chance he would be accused of the murder.
That's why he left.”</p>

<p>I saw Ranville nod, and Bartley continued:</p>

<p>“Patton told us that Mr. Warren never had the time
to examine the gift of three boxes which had been given
him at the last moment. The Chinaman told the
truth. He was but an odd coincident in the case, but
it was sufficient for a short while to throw us all away
from the real motive. Then when I heard your stories,
I began to have a faint suspicion—”</p>

<p>“You did,” interrupted Carter. “Of what?”</p>

<p>Bartley laughed. “A faint suspicion that perhaps
you had not told me every single detail. As the affair
stood, we were up against a stone wall. Warren had
been killed—but there was no motive for the crime.
Of course, that was absurd. I began to wonder if you
had overlooked anything. And then I decided there
was but one way I could see any light in this crime. It
was to apply some modern psychology—try and
discover the type of a man who would commit such an
absurd murder. That is—it was to us, but to the
murderer it was not. And then, all at once, you told me
very clearly what type of a man I must look for.”</p>

<p>“We did not,” was Carter's quick comment.</p>

<p>“Do you remember that bit of paper you found near
the body? That paper with the letters ‘Anani’?”</p>

<p>We nodded.</p>

<p>“For some reason none of you tried to figure out what
those letters might mean. They did mean something,
though the word was not completed. Did you ever
hear of ‘Ananias’?”</p>

<p>As the chief wrinkled up his brow in thought,
Ranville brought his hand down on his knee and laughed.
It was Carter who spoke, his voice impatient as he
said:</p>

<p>“Of course I did. He is in the Bible. Some sort of
a liar who was struck dead.”</p>

<p>“He is in the Bible, Carter,” was Bartley's smiling
reply. “But I am a little surprised you knew it. The
gentleman, as you remember, was struck dead—by God—for
telling a lie. You carry those letters to their
logical conclusion, and the word would have spelled out
‘Ananias.’ Our psychology will tell us the murderer
used that name instead of writing out another word,
‘Liar.’ ”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Bartley,” broke in the chief, “of all
damned foolishness that's the worst. No one could
call Mr. Warren that sort of a name. He was one of
the big men of the country. You are all wrong there.”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, Chief,” was the calm reply. “You
have made the reply the average man would make.
And even if an ordinary man killed Mr. Warren and
thought he lied, he would not have used the word
‘Ananias’ to express that fact. It gave me my first clew
to the type of man I wished to find. And there is
something else you must remember—”</p>

<p>As we bent forward in our chairs, his eyes swept
slowly over us. His voice was very grave when he
spoke.</p>

<p>“Mr. Warren was one of the great men of our land—one
of our greatest men of science. But you must
remember that there are many millions of people in this
country who would say that he was a ‘liar.’ Remember
his statement when he came out of China? I have
found the solution of the origin of man. The last
proof of evolution has been discovered.”</p>

<p>His eyes swept over us, and as no one spoke, he went
on:</p>

<p>“In every college in this world evolution is taught
as the only logical explanation of the origin of man.
Every intelligent person accepts it. You know,
however, that in America to-day there is a great campaign
against the subject. In fact, there is a campaign
against science as being ‘ungodly.’ Take a rabid,
bigoted man who is uneducated—one who sees in
science an attack upon religion and the Bible—and you
will find a man who would say Warren was what that
word implied—a ‘liar.’ ”</p>

<p>Ranville's face was very grave as his eyes rested
upon Bartley. Without waiting for a reply, Bartley
said very gravely:</p>

<p>“I have often wondered just how far you could
carry on a campaign of hatred and untruths without
reaping a fearful penalty. We have been breeding
intolerance in America for years. All over our country,
in the south and in the west, men are at the present
time carrying on a campaign against the teaching of
science. They are inflaming the minds of simple
people in what they call a great crusade. In the end
you cannot breed intolerance and hatred without some
time having to reap the full penalty. Warren paid the
price of that campaign of misrepresentation. It has
happened before. Intolerance—breeding hatred—and
then in an unbalanced mind flaming out in violence.</p>

<p>“I began to wonder if perhaps I had not found the
type who would commit such a crime, and also the
motive. When you told me of the faint cross cut into
the head of the dead man, I knew that we were
dealing with an unbalanced mind.”</p>

<p>He paused and lighted a fresh cigar; then added:</p>

<p>“And the night the minister came here I began to
wonder if he might be the man. This afternoon I was
sure of it.”</p>

<p>At our questioning glances he informed us as to
what had made him suspicious. He reminded us that
the minister had broken out in a rather wild attack
upon what he said was the fact that evolution was
responsible for people not going to church. Then he
added that when the clergyman had expressed his
opinion that Warren's discoveries could not be given to the
world, he had been corrected by Carter's statement
that Mr. Warren's assistant was coming to finish the
book.</p>

<p>He remarked that only the fact he was suspicious of
the man, perhaps caused him to notice the look which
passed over his face when he made his statement
regarding Patton. It was a look of consternation and
of hatred. From that moment he had begun to have
his suspicions regarding the minister. One other thing
convinced him they were true.</p>

<p>The chief had been following Bartley's story with the
closest attention. In part, I believed that he was not
sure Bartley's reasoning was correct. I could see the
puzzled look sweep across his face, and once or twice
he shook his head as if he did not agree. It was his
voice which asked:</p>

<p>“What was the other thing?”</p>

<p>“Pelt and I were in the minister's study this
afternoon. I made my call at a time I knew he was out. I
had seen him go down the lake in his boat. There was
nothing very much out of the way in his study—that is,
on first glance. His books were mostly controversial
theological works, and a good many of them were
attacks upon evolution. But in a bookcase which had a
glass door covered by cloth I found something else.
To start with, the books in the case were a weird
mixture. There were a great many books upon
flagellation—the worst sort of books. Then there were a
number dealing with the celebrated Girard case. That
was a famous case of sadism under the guise of religion.
Also there were the five pamphlets which covered the
Lepworth school matter.”</p>

<p>There came a short expression from Ranville. As
the rest of us looked blankly at the two men, Bartley
enlightened us.</p>

<p>“The Lepworth school affair is a very celebrated case
in the realm of sexual psychology. The schoolmaster,
a young man named Woods, aroused England over
sixty years ago by the brutal and cruel punishments
he inflicted upon his pupils. He managed to escape
to America. There is no doubt the man was sexually
unbalanced. To-day we would call it a pathological
condition. But standing on that shelf was a genealogy
of the Woods family—that branch of it. And that
schoolmaster, who had to flee England, was the
grandfather of the minister.</p>

<p>“Now I do not know much about Woods. He was
forced out of England and came to this country. He
made money, we do know. But the fact he built this
church tells a good deal. It was, no doubt, his gesture
to the Almighty—his attempt to win forgiveness for
the sins of the flesh. To-day we know another thing.
Any textbook upon heredity will tell you that children
inherit their qualities more from their grandparents
than their parents. And here was the minister, and in
his blood was that unbalanced make-up of the English
schoolmaster. In his case it made him a bigot without
friends and also whipped him into queer reform
movements. It also explains the horrible books I found in
his case. And I might add that I found the missing
volumes of the De Sade.</p>

<p>“The genealogy told more. The minister's father
married a woman named Wright. After the minister
was born she was placed in an insane asylum, where
she died. You can see from the standpoint of heredity
what took place. The sadistic strain in the blood of
the grandfather mixed in the unbalanced blood of the
woman—and the minister was the result. From such
a type you look for your odd reforms—your fantastic
crimes.”</p>

<p>In the silence which followed there came the plaintive
voice of the chief:</p>

<p>“But still I don't understand why he killed
Warren.”</p>

<p>“Well,” came Bartley's voice, “let us start at the
beginning. Here you have the minister. His heredity
is very bad. His entire life, that is, the things he did,
showed that he was a sad neurotic. He hated pleasure;
he hated all things which normal people enjoy. In
fact most of the wild, rabid fanatics are the same type.
But with him there was a double danger.</p>

<p>“We know to-day that there is not much difference
between the person who reacts violently in a sexual
manner and the one who goes to a wild extreme in
religious matters. Our psychology has proven they are
alike, from hundreds of cases. You had here an
unbalanced man. The anti-evolution group, of which he
was a member, had read Warren's statement—the last
proof of evolution had been found. Now to him that
would be absurd; and, at the same time, he would look
upon Warren as an enemy of God.</p>

<p>“Let us suppose he brooded over the matter day
after day. He might have even prayed that Warren
would be found wrong. Then to add flame to his
unbalanced thoughts came the news that Warren was to write
his book in the very place where the minister lived.
That did not improve matters. So one day he went to
see Warren. I think I can picture what happened.”</p>

<p>“What?” came the chief's eager voice.</p>

<p>“I think the minister went into Warren's library with
the purpose of begging that he would not publish his
book. In his unbalanced mind he would see nothing
out of the way in such a request. You can picture what
Warren must have said. It was like oil to a flame. As
the minister looked at the scientist he would see him
as the very enemy of society. Then, without a doubt,
something snapped in his brain. He rose to say
‘good-by’ and suddenly stabbed him. In his first wild frenzy
he thought of himself as doing the work of God. The
cross was a symbol of that. And when he wrote the
word ‘Ananias,’ the same thought was in his mind.</p>

<p>“Just what happened after that we do not know.
His frenzy would not last long. Remember he was not
technically insane—only unbalanced upon several
things, with a warped mind. It is my opinion he went
away and then returned later. Perhaps he
remembered the door was open. Perhaps when he came to his
right mind, he realized what he had done and went
back to see if he left a clew. And then it was he who
must have broken the bookcase to take those books—books
he must have often heard of, but was unable to
secure.”</p>

<p>At that moment there came a voice from the
doorway:</p>

<p>“May I come in?”</p>

<p>We turned to see the secretary. She was wearing a
gay-colored dressing gown which must have belonged
to Carter. Her face was rather pale, but otherwise she
showed little signs of the experience she had been
through. We rose to our feet, and Ranville found her
a chair. She dropped into it and smiled faintly as she
turned to Carter:</p>

<p>“Did you telephone my aunt?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>Carter rose with a jump and said sheepishly that he
had never thought of it. As he started for the door
the girl stopped him, saying that no doubt the chief
would be willing to take her home in a few moments.
The chief agreed to this, but said he wanted to hear
what had happened to her.</p>

<p>Her story was a very brief one. She had gone home
to her supper and, when it was over, returned to the
library. As she came up the steps of the building, to
her great surprise, she heard a shot within. She rushed
to the door and went a few feet within the room. To
her consternation, the minister was near the desk and
in his hand was a gun. He turned at her cry.</p>

<p>She gave a shudder at the recollection. His face was
a vivid red, and his eyes blazed as he looked at her.
She said that she thought he was crazy. With a weird
cry, as she turned to run from the room, he made a dash
after her. Just as his hand was about to fall upon her,
she must have fainted, for she remembered no more
until she came to in the boat house—alone.</p>

<p>Though she tried to open the two doors of the room,
she discovered they were locked on the outside. She
yelled as loud as she could, but the approaching storm
and the high wind drowned her voice. And then when
she thought it would be useless to cry out again, she
heard the door open. A moment later the door leading
into the room was swung aside, and the lights flashed
on. Just what happened after that she did not know.
There was a short moment when, to her horror, she
again saw the minister—saw him creep over the floor
in her direction—and then she said she must have
fainted again.</p>

<p>We said nothing, and then with an appealing look,
which took us all in, the girl asked:</p>

<p>“I have just one faint recollection. As I fainted the
last time, the minister was saying something about a
sacrifice. What did he mean?”</p>

<p>It was Bartley who spoke, and his words were, of
course, untrue:</p>

<p>“I think you must have been mistaken,” was his
short reply.</p>

<p>The girl shook her head as if in doubt, but settled
back in her chair. In the silence there came the voice
of the chief:</p>

<p>“How about the murder of the gardener?”</p>

<p>“That's more simple,” was the answer. “You must,
of course, understand, Chief, that when the minister
realized what he had done, he was torn between two
conflicting emotions. First, of course, was the thought
that he had done a good deed—he had saved his God
from blasphemy. That idea grew upon him. It did
not, however, do away with the other feeling. After
all, he had committed a murder, and he knew it. In
the few days after the crime he must have been fast
approaching actual insanity.</p>

<p>“Then there came a startling fact. He was told that
Patton would complete the book—the book which
would give the world Warren's discovery. He had
killed a man to prevent that book being written, and
his crime was in vain. The world collapsed for him at
the moment he realized that his crime had been
useless.”</p>

<p>“But he did not know Patton,” barked out the chief.</p>

<p>“Yes, he did,” replied Carter. “I introduced them
this morning.”</p>

<p>Bartley took up the thought. “Yes, he had met him.
That's why he made his mistake. He knew the suit
Patton was wearing. When he saw the back of the
gardener as he turned to escape from the room, he
thought it was Patton and shot him. In build, height
and general appearance they were about the same.”</p>

<p>“No doubt it's all so,” retorted the chief, “but what
I can't understand is this: What did the gardener see,
what was it made him turn, as you say, to leave the
library?”</p>

<p>“He must have seen the minister destroying the
manuscript on the desk. He tried to get out of the
room without being heard in order to tell Patton. And
he was shot. As Miss Harlan screamed, the minister
rushed at her. Her fainting no doubt saved her life.
He took her down to the boat, then to the boat house.
The rest you know. In that startled moment when
the eyes of the murderer fell upon Patton, and he saw
his victim standing before him, he realized he had killed
the wrong man. His heart could not stand the strain.”</p>

<p>“That was lucky for him,” was the chief's dry
comment. “But, at that, he was crazy.”</p>

<p>“Yes—and—no,” was Bartley's reply. “In the
beginning he simply was a neurotic—unbalanced, not
insane. In the end the conflict between his two selves
drove him insane. If you mean he was insane the last
few hours of his life, I agree with you.”</p>

<p>Silence fell, which the chief broke to say that he
thought he better return to town. The secretary went
up to her room to dress, returning in a few moments.
At the door she turned to thank us, and then said good
night. We stood for a moment in the open door and
watched the car leave the drive; then went back into
the house. As we moved rather nervously about the
room, Carter paused and asked:</p>

<p>“John, what would that man have done to that girl
if we had not reached the boat house?”</p>

<p>“Killed her. You remember his repeated cry—a
sacrifice—a sacrifice. His mind was gone then. Upon
his conscience, if he had any, were two murders.
Dimly he wished to make his peace with God, and he
remembered the idea which runs through so much
theology—the sacrifice of blood. He would have killed
her as an offering—the offering which his unbalanced
mind thought was demanded.”</p>

<p>The thought was a horrible one, and I gave a little
shiver. As the men sank down into their chairs, there
came a silence which no one broke. In it again I heard
the weird tones of the organ as my mind went back to
the moments I had spent in the church balcony. I
shuddered as I thought of the frenzied voice of the
minister with his wild cry for a sacrifice. And then my
eyes fell upon Ranville.</p>

<p>He was sitting in a chair by the table. His face was
very thoughtful, and once or twice I saw him knit his
brows. As he lifted his head, our eyes met for a second.
Then his glance strayed over to the table. On its
surface was the bottle of Scotch. His hand went forth,
and he poured out a small drink. Holding the glass
in his hand, he turned to Bartley:</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Bartley, you pulled it off. But there is
one thing I wish to tell you.”</p>

<p>We turned to look at the Englishman's face. There
was a little twinkle in his eyes, and a smile played over
his face. He raised his glass to his lips after a gesture
in Bartley's direction. Then, as he drained it, he said,
and there was a laughing note in his voice:</p>

<p>“You pulled it off. But do you know I think the
Yard could have done the same thing?”</p>
